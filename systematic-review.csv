Perrino et al. 2013,2013,Advancing Science Through Collaborative Data Sharing and Synthesis,Perspectives on Psychological Science,"collaborative research, data sharing, data synthesis, scientific equity, integrative data analysis",Journal article,"The demand for researchers to share their data has increased dramatically in recent years. There is a need to replicate and confirm scientific findings to bolster confidence in many research areas. Data sharing also serves the critical function of allowing synthesis of findings across trials. As innovative statistical methods have helped resolve barriers to synthesis analyses, data sharing and synthesis can help answer research questions that cannot be answered by individual trials alone. However, the sharing of data among researchers remains challenging and infrequent. This article aims to (a) increase support for data sharing and synthesis collaborations among researchers to advance scientific knowledge and (b) provide a model for establishing these collaborations using the example of the ongoing National Institute of Mental Health’s Collaborative Data Synthesis on Adolescent Depression Trials. This study brings together datasets from existing prevention and treatment trials in adolescent depression, as well as researchers and stakeholders, to answer questions about “for whom interventions work” and “by what pathways interventions have their effects.” This is critical to improving interventions, including increasing knowledge about intervention efficacy among minority populations, or what we call “scientific equity.” The collaborative model described is relevant to fields with research questions that can only be addressed by synthesizing individual-level data.",Ebsco,Psychology,"National Institute of Mental Health’s Collaborative Data Synthesis on Adolescent Depression Trials, This study brings
together datasets from existing prevention and treatment trials in adolescent depression, as well as researchers and
stakeholders, to answer questions about “for whom interventions work” and “by what pathways interventions have
their effects.”","Integrative data analysis, meta-analysis","Data ownership: ""Data ownership is a complex topic, and although it is common to speak about “owning data,” it may be more accurate, in the realm of grant-generated data, to say that what investigators and their institutions really own are rights to access data. The institution that supported the study—which is typically the actual recipient of the grant from the funding agency—has access rights. Individual research participants may also have rights to their own data. The public, whose tax dollars funded the study, also has rights to the aggregate data (Guttmacher et al., 2009). The investigators who collected the data may have more of a sense of “psychological ownership” than others and they have a vested interest in exploring the data and preventing."" p. 435

Data protection, privacy: ""investigators, their institutions, and institutional review boards (IRBs) have a responsibility to protect the privacy rights and welfare of study participants as outlined in the study protocol and informed consent process. However, explicitly restrictive consent form language may make data sharing impossible. Investigators with NIH grants, especially those whose grant terms and conditions detail a data-sharing plan, have a responsibility to ensure that the informed consent language is consistent with data sharing and avoids excessively restrictive terms (e.g., specifically guaranteeing that data will not be shared with others; NIH, 2004). For recent studies, excessively restrictive consen  language should be unusual because many funding institutions, professional organizations, and journals have policies that require data sharing."" p. 435

Though individual study investigators have expressed a strong interest in the scientific benefits of data sharing through CDSADT and the opportunity to better understand the effects of these interventions, some expressed reservations about data sharing—they felt that it would be time-consuming, that their data might not be correctly interpreted, and in particular that they wished to protect their intellectual investments and ensure that the CDSADT team did not publish findings that the individual study team was planning to publish.p. 440

All of the steps in the process of developing these research collaborations for collaborative data sharing and synthesis require time and resources. p. 440

The correct interpretation of data has been another concern of investigators. This has included the possibility that the facilitating team might not fully understand assessment measures, interventions, and populations being studied and might misinterpret the effects of the intervention. Synthesis findings are checked carefully against existing publications, and individual investigative teams are contacted when clarification is needed. In addition, concerns about scientific validity have been addressed during the regular stakeholder conference calls when the facilitating team has an opportunity to further understand the data, studies, and stakeholders and ensure the proper interpretation of data analyses. p. 439

Time: Investigators’ practical concerns have also included limited time availability to prepare the data for sharing. p. 439


","Stakeholders: ""Both mental health advocates and mental health service providers have been identified as important stakeholders in the synthesis study’s findings because of their need to apply the findings to shape practice and to advocate for the next generation of programs to prevent and treat depression. The interest of community members is to promote research that improves interventions for adolescents who have depression or who are at risk for depression. All of these groups are considered to be research partners in the collaborative data synthesis project and are expected to share knowledge and build upon each other’s expertise to improve the research and utility of findings."" p. 437

Common goals: developing partnerships involves individual discussions with stakeholders to involve them actively in the collaborative data synthesis study by establishing shared goals for the overall project and goals for the stakeholders themselves. In the CDSADT study, common goals emerging from these discussions have covered substantive issues as well as methodological or process issues, all of which relate to improving adolescent depression interventions. p. 439

The CDSADT study’s facilitating team has supported the aspirations and goals of individual investigators in mining their own data and ensured that these investigators receive recognition for that work. The potential that this collaborative study holds for the advancement of the field, in particular the answering of research questions that cannot be answered through individual efforts, has generated significant enthusiasm and participation among the stakeholders. p. 439

All of the steps in the process of developing these research collaborations for collaborative data sharing and synthesis require time and resources. The funding provided by NIMH has been a critical resource for the CDSADT study as it has allowed the facilitating team to contact and engage collaborators and stakeholders, address issues of data rights and data protection through drafting data sharing plans, gather and manage data, develop and refine statistical methodologies, conduct analyses, and work with the collaborators to interpret findings and delineate new research questions. Although collaborative data synthesis is more cost effective and less time intensive than conducting a new study with a sufficiently large and diverse sample to address pressing research questions, it does have financial and time investments associated with it. p. 439

Thus, the facilitating team has supported individual investigators in continuing to analyze their data and receiving recognition for their work and has emphasized how the synthesis work can produce findings that will ultimately inform and advance the investigators’ work.1 Furthermore, all stakeholders have been invited to quarterly group telephone calls, which are used to provide updates on the analytic progress, facilitate continued reciprocal feedback between stakeholders and the facilitating team, and provide an opportunity to monitor investigators’ commitment to the project. The use of data sharing agreements—delineating how areas of possible contention will be addressed—has helped to alleviate concerns and articulate benefits to individual research groups. These plans have also ensured that the process is transparent and allows for input at key junctures. p. 439","p. 434: There is a need to replicate and confirm scientific findings to bolster confidence in many research areas. Data sharing also serves the critical function of allowing synthesis of findings across trials. As innovative statistical methods have helped resolve barriers to synthesis analyses, data sharing and synthesis can help answer research questions that cannot be answered by individual trials alone.

Given their direct experiences coping with depression and its treatment, adolescents with depression and their families have perhaps the greatest stake in the outcomes of synthesis studies such as the CDSADT study. The ability to pool and analyze data from multiple research studies is important to help clarify findings about the safety and efficacy of interventions. p. 440

Objectives: In this article, we review sovereignty, research ethics, and data-sharing considerations when doing community-based participatory health–related or natural-resource–related research with American Indian nations and present a model material and data-sharing agreement that meets tribal and university requirements. Discussion: Only tribal nations themselves can identify potential adverse outcomes, and they can do this only if they understand the assumptions and methods of the proposed research. Tribes must be truly equal partners in study design, data collection, interpretation, and publication. Advances in protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) are also applicable to IRB reviews, as are principles of sovereignty and indigenous rights, all of which affect data ownership and control. Conclusions: Academic researchers engaged in tribal projects should become familiar with all three areas: sovereignty, ethics and informed consent, and IPR.

Anthropolgy",no inquiry,"Researchers' concerns regarding cultural differences between researcher and study object, unrealistic expectations, organizational constraints, ethical violations: However, cultural differences, unrealistic expectations, organizational constraints, and ongoing ethical and data-sharing violations can create barriers that stifle or end effective partnerships between universities and sovereign tribal nations (Wong and Poon 2010). Few nonnative researchers possess an awareness of Native American culture and belief systems, including the continuing effect of American colonialism on the peoples they seek to study. For example, researchers may choose a model of “reductionist science” that relies on hypothetical quantitative models to determine disease excesses in communities with environmental contamination, while ignoring tribal community knowledge about health impacts and environmental abnormalities. Or, community members may not be included in scientific decision-making bodies that set standards of exposure and risk to community members (Quigley 2001). p. 6

Concerns regarding data ownership and trust between researcher and study object (in this case ethnographic research): Additional challenges may center on trust, data ownership, and sovereign rights. For example, there may be differences between conceptions of how knowledge may be generated, used, shared, and, ultimately, “owned.” Tsosie (2007) observed that in Western understandings, knowledge is generated by individuals who have autonomy in determining whether to share it. Once knowledge is shared, it is free for all to use, with only limited exceptions. p. 6

“within tribal communities, there may be an assumption that knowledge is part of the group’s overall identity, but that certain members have the duty to keep the knowledge on behalf of the group and that it would be inappropriate for such individuals to share the knowledge, even with other members of the group” (Tsosie 2007).

","clear termes: ""to the researchers and to the community. It is important to delineate early in the project how data will be handled beyond the traditional scope of university research rules and to resolve potential conflicts around data interpretation and publication (Resnick and Kennedy 2010).

Sieber 1988,1988,Data sharing: Defining problems and seeking solutions.,Law and Human Behavior,---,Journal article,"Describes a range of meanings or contexts for sharing of research data in which some kinds of sharing are more problematic than others. Objections to data sharing are bolstered by examples from the more difficult end of this range. Constrained sharing, including possible contractual and licensing agreements rather than merely ""handing over the data,"" is a likely norm to emerge at the more difficult end of the spectrum. A case example suggests that even the most difficult cases may yield to constrained sharing solutions that benefit all parties involved. It is concluded that if research is conducted with sharing in mind, and if the scientist is acquainted with constrained sharing, then the dilemmas that pose as arguments against sharing will occur rarely. ",Ebsco,Law & Human Behavior,,no inquiry,"Confidential data of patients: Data may be confidential, and the disclosure of the data may have clearly harmful consequences for the research participants, the possibility of future data gathering, the scientist, or others; e.g., videotapes of therapist-patient interaction filmed with a strict promise of total confidentiality could not be shared without obliterating all visual and verbal clues to the identity of the patients. p. 200

Data can be partly proprietary, data might have proprietary value, copyright violations: Data may have important proprietary or economic value; e.g., the software of equipment that runs the laboratory process may give the scientist considerable advantage over competitors; the data may have economic value to the sponsors and their competitors. Alternatively, the data or equipment may not be copyrighted or patented so that the intellectual property rights of the scientist need to be protected; or the data may be copyrighted, and purchased from a commercial archive (e.g., Bionet data) and the sharing of these data may violate copyright law. p. 200

Dataset offers more exploitation possibilities and data collectors want to use it: The actual data may be far more extensive than what has been reported in copyrighted form and may comprise a data bank that the scientist wishes to mine for the next several years. The actual samples that another wishes to borrow and analyze may be irreplaceable or difficult and expensive to collect. Extremely valuable know-how, unpatented devices, or samples may justifiably be withheld from sharing unless the recipient offers a quid pro quo that is acceptable to the donor p. 200

The ones that request datasets from a researcher are unknown to him or her: One hears about data recipients whose enthusiasm dwindles rapidly when faced with bulging boxes of disarrayed and (perhaps deliberately undecipherable) data, and about requests for complex data sets by persons of unknown credentials who do not respond to the potential donor's queries about the potential recipient's intended use of the data. As these examples suggest, responsible data sharing entails obligations on the part of both parties, and possibly a contractual agreement between them. p. 202

Misuse of trust: For example, one individual, when quite junior, had borrowed raw data from colleagues at another institution, and was then asked by a very senior colleague at her own institution to let him make another set of the data to ""play with."" The young faculty member did not want to refuse the request outright, and did not have the foresight to suggest that the senior colleague write to the lenders for permission to copy the data. The senior colleague reanalyzed the data and published a scathing critique. p. 203

Researchers have not been informed enough about data sharing: Most respondents indicate that they perceive data sharing as generally advantageous to science and to individual scientists, but that they had not thought about it until we asked their opinion. p. 203

Ethical obligations: Recognizing the range of events that may be subsumed under data sharing, it is obvious that some of these events may entail conflicting ethical obligations. p. 206","The kind of data determens the ease with ehich data is shared; qualitative and quantitative data; it depends on skill, technology and equipment used to gather and analyse them; to examine the work of others, scientists my need access to the raw data and the samples p. 200

As examples, an investigator may (1) enter into a research contract requiring delivery of the data to the funding agency on completion of the contract; (2) accept a grant from an agency requiring that, on completion of the research, the data be documented, stored in a standard machine-readablef orm, and shared with any scientist upon request; (3) submit a manuscript to a journal requiring availability of the raw data, on request, to referees and upon publication to other scientists; (4) do research which a colleague questions, then proposes to reanalyze collaboratively with her; (5) gather data which a colleague wishes to borrow and use as sample data for training students; (6) archive data so that potential borrowers will have ready access to it; (7) collect, with government funding, confidential data that another vitally affected government organization requests for purposes of reanalysis (verification), refinement, and extension, with no guarantee that the data will not be used for administrative decision making that may affect the subjects adversely; (8) collect data with private funding which a court subpoenaes because the data are relevant to proving or defending against a claim; or, (9) do confidential research, without funding, the conclusions of which are attacked by a competitor, who requests access to the raw data. p. 201

Nelson 2009,2009,Data sharing: Empty archives,Nature,---,News Feature,"Most researchers agree that open access to data is the scientific ideal, so what is stopping it happening? Bryn Nelson investigates why many researchers choose not to share.",Ebsco,interdisciplinary,Nature magazine article ,no inquiry,"Researchers' concerns about time for data formatting: When the time came, scientists couldn’t find their data, or didn’t understand how to use the archive, or lamented that they just didn’t have any more hours left in the day to spend on this business. p. 160

Misuse of own work, unclear which rights remain at the scientist: What will keep work from being scooped, poached or misused? What rights will the scientists have to relinquish? Where will they get the hours and money to find and format everything? p. 160

But those discipline-specific successes are the exception rather than the rule in science. All too many observations lie isolated and forgotten on personal hard drives and CDs, trapped by technical, legal and cultural barriers — a problem that open-data advocates are only just beginning to solve. p. 160

Disciplinary culture: wide variations in the culture of data sharing. Fields such as atmospheric science and oceanography, Parsons says, have welldeveloped traditions of free and open access, and robust databases. But fields such as wildlife ecology and many of the social sciences do not. p. 161

Collecting data is often a huge effort: In other fields, however, the main barriers to data sharing are concerns about quantity and quality. The US National Science Foundation’s (NSF’s) Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave Observatory (LIGO), for example, uses giant detectors in Louisiana and Washington to search for gravitational waves that might indicate the presence of rare phenomena such as colliding black holes or merging stars. LIGO is also working with the Virgo consortium, which operates a similar detector near Pisa, Italy. Neither team has detected the signal they are looking for yet — but that’s not surprising: gravitational waves are expected to be extraordinarily faint. The key to detecting them is to eliminate every possible source of spurious vibration in the detectors, whether from seismic events, electrical storms, road traffic or even from the surf on distant beaches. It requires what Szabolcs Márka, a physicist at Columbia University in New York and the university’s lead scientist for LIGO, calls “a really

Missing data standards (metadata): ""How data should be shared is also a substantial problem. A prime example is the issue of data standards: the conventions that spell out exactly how the digital information is formatted, and exactly how the contextual information (metadata) is listed. In some disciplines it is comparatively easy to agree on standards, says Clifford Lynch, executive director of the Coalition for Networked Information based in Washington DC, which represents academia on data and networking issues. “If you look at something like the sequencing of a genome, there’s a whole lot of tacit stuff that’s already settled,” he says. “Sequencing one genome is very similar to sequencing another.” But for other groups — say, environmental scientists trying to understand the spread of a pollutant — the choice of common standards is far less obvious. The all-too-frequent result is fragmented and often mutually incomprehensible scientific information. And that, in turn, stifles innovation, says James Boyle, a law professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and a founding board member of Creative Commons, a non-profit organization that supports creative content sharing."" p. 160

Missing standards: For example, web users are using applications such as Google Earth to plot the spread of pandemics2 or to collect information on the effects of climate change. All that is needed, says Boyle, are common languages and formats for data. p. 160

No widespread datasharing unless it is a requirement for every grant: Nonetheless, until data sharing becomes a requirement for every grant, says Daniel Gardner, a physiologist and biophysicist at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, “people aren’t going to do it in as widespread of a way as we would like”. Right now, he says, “you can’t ask large numbers of people to do it, because it’s a lot of work and because in many cases the databases don’t exist for it. So there is kind of a chicken and egg problem here.” p. 161

Huge effort to make old data available because of old software standards: If you try to look at a file that you wrote with a word processor 20 years ago, good luck.” In the same way, if a data set isn’t readable by the latest version of a database, it isn’t usable. So an archive may well have to choose between tossing old data out, and paying to preserve the out-ofdate software required to make sense of them. p. 162

Personal data and privacy: Even more challenging are the legal minefields surrounding personal data and privacy. p. 162

Scientists do not share because the attribution is not sufficient (data citation): Another issue facing journals and data banks is how to ensure proper citations for data sets. “The one thing that people clearly care about in the sciences is attribution,” says Boyle. Without an agreed-on way of assigning credit for original data falling beyond the parameters of a publication, however, it’s no wonder that scientists are reluctant to share: their hard work may never be recognized by their employers or by granting agencies. p. 163","Perhaps not surprisingly, data-sharing advocates say, the power to prod researchers towards openness and consistency rests largely with those who have always had the most clout in science: the funding agencies, which can demand data sharing in return for support; the scientific societies, which can establish it as a precedent; and the journals, which can make sharing a condition of publication. p. 161

One solution would be for agencies to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet their archiving requirements. That can be difficult to arrange, says Boyle. “Infrastructure is the thing that we always fail to fund because it’s kind of everybody’s problem, and therefore it’s nobody’s problem.”","A similar reality check has greeted other data-sharing efforts. Most researchers happily embrace the idea of sharing. It opens up observations to independent scrutiny, fosters new collaborations and encourages further discoveries in old data sets. p. 160",-,yes

Stanley & Stanley 1988,1988,Data sharing: The primary researcher's perspective.,Law and Human Behavior,---,Journal article,"Identifies 2 important dimensions of data sharing: the degree to which the primary investigators may determine whether they will share their data (i.e., whether they are free to refuse data requests) and the reason for which the data set is being requested. The negative aspects of viewing data sharing as an obligation include increased burden on the primary investigator, lack of incentive to share data, loss of control over the use of data, and negative effects on scientific progress. Recommendations regarding data sharing policies are made in light of these negative effects",Ebsco,Psychology,,no inquiry,"Fear of falsification: The second dimension of requests to share data is the intended use of the primary data set. The reason commentators most commonly cite is verification or refutation of the original study (Boruch, 1985). With respect to requests for verification, the intent of the secondary analyst is to reanalyze the data using either identical statistical methods or techniques that the secondary investigator considers more sensitive or sophisticated. No new hypotheses would be explored in this instance p. 176

additional financial and time burdens on the primary investigator: Supplying data to other investigators can be both costly and time consuming. Data must be prepared in a way that is readily understandable to the requester. Codebooks cannot be written in a shorthand form and many incidentals of data collection that often are not formally documented must be made formal. Inevitably, questions will arise regarding the recordkeeping, and the primary investigator must allot time to answer these questions. Furthermore, the primary investigator in most circumstances would bear the burden of additional financial and personnel costs of reproducing the data, including photocopying and reproduction of computer disks. Granting agencies typically do not supply additional funds for extra staff time or supplies for data sharing. Therefore, the time, cost and effort spent on data sharing would be taken away from the primary goals of the research program. p. 176

Lack of rewards: The second negative aspect of data sharing is that few rewards accrue from this activity, even though it is seen as promoting scientific inquiry, and pressure exists within the research community to share data. In fact, instead of being rewarded, only negative consequences may result. Giving data to another investigator may mean simply that someone else will publish a finding based on data collected by the primary investigator prior to that investigator doing so. p. 177

Loss of control: The loss of control over the data set is one of the strongest drawbacks to sharing research data. The primary investigator may encounter several problems. First, the investigator may be concerned about the qualifications of the data requester. The nature of this concern is twofold: (a) the technical ability of the requester to understand and appropriately analyze the data, and (b) the ethical standards of the requester. p. 178","When viewed as an obligation, primary researchers would be required to supply their data to any researcher who requests access p. 173

academic institutions. On the other hand, the Ethical Principles of Psychologists (American Psychological Association, 1981) do not place an emphasis on data sharing as a valued goal. To the contrary, the Principles emphasize the importance of maintaining control over the integrity of data. For example, the Principles state that ""psychologists have the responsibility to attempt to prevent distortion, misuse or suppression of psychological findings by the institution or agency of which they are employees"" (APA, 1981, Principle 1). Furthermore, ""psychologists are obliged to clarify in advance . . . expectations for sharing and utilizing research data"" (APA, 1981, Principle 1). In short, although the APA Principles emphasize the need to clarify arrangements for use of data and to preserve the integrity of the data, they do not promote data sharing or support sharing of data as an ethical mandate p. 173

Scientists by and large are not mandated to supply their data to others, although there are arguments currently being made to condition grant awards on willingness to supply data to all requesters (Yolles, Conners, & Grufferman, 1986) p. 175

Further, the social climate in the research community creates psychological pressure to share data. This pressure may be intensified by the fact that withholding data may leave the impression of having something to hide. p. 175

1. Data sharing ought to remain a voluntary activity whenever possible, with the primary researcher retaining the right to permit or refuse access to their data. 2. Guidelines ought to be developed for the appropriate behavior of secondary analysts; e.g., an expectation that contradictory findings will be supplied to the primary investigator prior to publication, in order to offer the primary investigator the opportunity to discuss or refute the new interpretation. 3. Primary investigators should not be denied the opportunity to evaluate the data requester's credentials prior to giving the data set. It is appropriate to evaluate the requester's ability to analyze and interpret the data and to obtain some information on the individual's ethical standards. 4. Written agreements specifying the purpose of the data request ought to be encouraged. The limits of the data set's uses should be discussed and agreed upon prior to its release. For example, if the agreement is that the secondary researcher is to conduct a verification, then additional analyses are not to be conducted without the primary researcher's consent. Furthermore, the primary researcher should be able to specify whether or not the secondary researcher is permitted to give the data to any other researchers. 5. Finally, we ought to remember that a balance between data sharing and the development of original data should be maintained. In an effort to promote data sharing, it should not become an overvalued activity and consequently lead to an undervaluing of original contributions and the development of original data sets. Ultimately the goals of science may be hindered rather than promoted. p. 179","Although data sharing is seen as promoting openness in scientific inquiry and thus as being good for science, it ultimately may lead to negative consequences for the field. If data sharing becomes a more established or even mandated practice, more investigators are likely to request the data sets of others. Simply put, it is a lot easier, faster, and less costly to obtain someone else's data than it is to design a study, recruit participants, and collect and analyze data. Thus, we could end up with many fewer original data sets examining the same or similar questions. One of the basic tenets of the scientific method, the collection of data through multiple independent evaluations, may be compromised. Conducting many more analyses on one data set may seem cost effective but may ultimately slow progress since idiosyncracies of the original data set may take much longer to discover.","This position is a more difficult and less popular one to take than being a proponent of data sharing. Sharing research data openly and freely is often viewed as altruistic and signifying the openness of scientific inquiry and advancing the pursuit of knowledge. Furthermore, it appears to promote ""good"" science by allowing independent analysis and review of one's data. Although a categorical rejection of the positive aspects of data sharing would be invalid, current arguments in its favor are based on a rather simplistic and idealized view of research and life as a researcher p. 173",yes

At 2 min after intravenous injection of biologically active 125I-salmon calcitonin, free hormone was separated from bound hormone by intracardiac perfusion with lactated Ringer's followed by fixation with 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Various tissues were removed and processed for light and electron microscope radioautography. These were compared to tissues removed from animals that received identical amounts of labeled hormone with a large excess of unlabeled calcitonin. Among the tissues investigated, kidney and bone demonstrated labeling. In kidney, most silver grains were located over vesicles below the brush border of cells of theproximal convoluted tubules. These grains were still present after simultaneous injection of excess unlabeled hormone and most likely represented binding to sites involved with ingestion and degradation of hormone from the urinary filtrate. In contrast, grains localized to the basal surfaces of distal convoluted tubule cells were significantly reduced in number in control animals and represented sites of saturable, specific hormone binding. In bone, specific binding sites were found only at the periphery of osteoclasts. These labeled cells were located at resorption sites examined in tibia, humerus, and alveolar bone. This demonstration of the localization of 124I-calcitonin in situ provides a new approach for study the interaction of calcium-regulating hormones with their target cells.",Ebsco,,,,,,,,no

Our findings are organized along major types of data sharing in CER applications (ie, institution-to-institution, institution hosted, and public release). We made recommendations based on specific scenarios. Limitation: We limited the scope of our study to methods that demonstrated practical impact, eliminating many theoretical studies of privacy that have been surveyed elsewhere. We further limited our study to data sharing for data tables, rather than complex genomic, set valued, time series, text, image, or network data.

Pitt & Tang 2012,2012,What Should Be the Data Sharing Policy of Cognitive Science?,TOPICS,Data sharing; Repository; Open science,Commentary,"There is a growing chorus of voices in the scientific community calling for greater openness in the sharing of raw data that lead to a publication. In this commentary, we discuss the merits of sharing, common concerns that are raised, and practical issues that arise in developing a sharing policy. We suggest that the cognitive science community discuss the topic and establish a data-sharing policy.",Ebsco,"Psychology, Cognitive Science",Cognitive Science data-sharing,no inquiry,"it might be easy to agree in principle to share data, but crafting a policy that ensures all parties involved are treated fairly requires care and sensitivity to the idiosyncrasies of the science. Any policy must protect the participants whose data will be shared and the investigators who collected the data. Protection of human participants is comparatively much more straightforward given that national and institutional guidelines are well developed. Through IRBs, safeguards are put in place to ensure risks to participants are minimal and confidentiality and anonymity are maintained. One of the biggest worries is ensuring data are de-identified prior to sharing, a procedure we suspect most cognitive scientists already practice. By collecting the data, the investigators possess some intellectual rights to the data. One of these should be having a say in the conditions under which the data are made available to others. The original researchers might have plans to perform follow-up analyses or reuse their data to address other theoretical questions. They should be given the opportunity to pursue these ideas without fear of competition from others. There could also be proprietary or contractual obligations that could restrict sharing. How are the rights of the original investigators protected while at the same time providing others access to the data? One solution is to give researchers the option to embargo their data for a time period (e.g., 6 months to 1 year) after publication of the manuscript (Whitlock, 2011). This solution is a compromise that provides the researcher with time to complete or make significant headway on planned research, while also fulfilling the obligation to make the data available to the community in a timely manner. If the data are sensitive in any way, contracts that place restrictions on their use, as well as restricting the pool of qualified users, can be put in place. A reluctance to share can stem from a deeper concern that sharing could harm one’s career. By making data publicly available, the researcher loses control of how it will be used and could be the target of abuse (e.g., purposely hunting for errors or discrepancies). A means of addressing this concern must be part of a data-sharing policy, as there is no place for bullying in science. To minimize such unpleasant interactions, which are probably very rare, Vickers (2006) suggests that when data are reused, the original researcher be involved in the reuse in some way. This could include collaborating with those who want to reuse the data, reviewing the manuscript that emerges from the re-analysis, or being given the opportunity to write a reply should the re-analysis be published. Such a policy also minimizes the misuse of data. That said, validation is part of the scientific process. Scrutiny should be permitted so that science can be corrected when necessary (the reproducible research movement has a similar goal). This is especially important if the findings have significant societal consequences (Godlee, Smith, & Marcovitch, 2011). Other concerns about sharing can be found in The Governing Council of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) (2001) and Gøtzsche (2011). Although they vary in their relevance for cognitive science, like the above issues, none is insurmountable. Assuming data sharing is considered worthwhile by the community, a policy should be put in place with the recognition that it is a work in progress. p. 218

Unless data sharing is part of the culture (e.g., astrophysics), any policy without some means of enforcement will probably result in poor compliance (Guttmacher, Nabel, & Collins, 2009). Wicherts, Borsboom, Kats, and Molenaar (2006) requested data sets from the authors of 141 articles that appeared in three journals published by the American Psychological Association, which has an explicit policy that authors share their data with those who ask for it. Only 26% of the data sets were provided. Compliance is only somewhat better in disciplines in which data repositories exist and journals expect submission. Alshekh-Ali, Qureshi, Al-Mallah, and Ioannidis (2011; see also Savage & Vickers, 2009) surveyed data availability in 500 articles published in journals with the 50 highest impact factors in all of science, which differ widely in their policies on data sharing. Of those that had a sharing policy, only 41% of the papers fully complied. Piwowar (2011) reports a similar level of compliance in archiving gene expression microarray data (45%), for which there are multiple centers for data storage and strict enforcement by some journals. Research in this field can be funded by large NIH grants, which require an explicit policy on sharing as a condition of funding. Although sharing was more likely from such studies, it was surprisingly low p. 219

Why are sharing rates not higher? In a survey inquiring about the data-sharing attitudes and practices of geneticists, the most common reason for denying a request for data was the amount of work required (Campbell et al., 2002). Researchers are busy people, and locating even recently collected data, not to mention trying to reconstruct how the data are organized, can take more time than one is willing to spend. This attitude is not unexpected because for most scientists, requests for data are sufficiently rare that data are not prepared for storage with sharing in mind. But as with new rules in federal grant and IRB applications, the process can become routine after one has implemented a system. To become a priority, sharing has to be valued. In genetics, those who re-use their own data or data from others are more likely to share, suggesting the value of sharing increases with experience (Piwowar, 2011). Reluctance to share is not widespread in all disciplines, and changes in attitude have led some to revise policy. After the results of a survey of ecologists and evolutionary biologists showed that 95% favor archiving their data, editors of multiple journals and publishers agreed to require all authors of accepted manuscripts to submit their data to an online database (Whitlock, McPeek, Rausher, Rieseberg, & Moore, 2010). Such a change no doubt arose from extended discussion and eventual agreement among most community members that the change was in the best interest of the discipline. Consensus building is moving more slowly in one discipline closer to home. From 2000 to 2006, the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience required all fMRI data to be submitted to fmridc.org as a condition of publication. In as few as 4 years after its creation, tangible benefits of the archive were appearing (Van Horn, Grafton, Rockmore, & Gazzaniga, 2004). Openfmri.org is a new outlet for such data, and renewed calls are being made to increase sharing in the field (Visscher & Weissman, 2011; Yarkoni, et al., 2010). Money can have a profound effect on a sharing policy. Who is going to pay for the cost of building and maintaining a repository? Societies and publishers? Although federal funds might be available to create a repository, sustainability is the more costly. However easy and automated the submission and storage and retrieval processes, personnel will be needed to maintain the site and ensure best practices in data curation. Relatedly, what level of reuse, which might occur slowly, will be necessary to justify the investment? For these reasons, no-frills repositories (e.g., Dataverse) can be a sensible first step. There are also concerns about the financial repercussions of implementing a data-sharing policy that veers too far from the norms of other journals in a field. Would such a policy threaten the existence or prestige of the journal because authors would avoid publishing in it? If circulation and citations drop, there could be pressure from the publisher to reverse the policy, as a journal’s policies must reflect the opinions of the community it serves. Such concerns might seem worrisome enough for some to prefer to maintain the status quo. However, another recent example, from the field of economics, shows change can be smooth and successful. In 2005, the American Economics Review, a leading journal in the field, implemented a strict data availability policy (www.aeaweb.org/aer/data.php) that requires submission of all data and analysis programs upon submission of a manuscript for review. Other economics journals followed suit and adopted the same policy. That this change has been in place for so long suggests any negative impact has thus far been negligible. p. 219f",,"What is prompting the move to greater sharing? There is clear evidence that sharing benefits science. Examples of this are numerous in genetics, where repositories of data have been available to researchers for a decade. One of the biggest success stories in this field has been the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP). Technology and resources generated and shared by HGP have had a major impact on research across the life sciences and will benefit future generations of researchers. Piwowar, Vision, and Whitlock (2011) studied reuse of data sets in the Gene Expression Omnibus database and estimated that 2711 data sets deposited in 2007 had made third-party contributions to more than 1150 published articles by the end of 2010. Data sharing benefits science in many ways. As illustrated in the preceding paragraph, it stimulates new research. Researchers design a study with a particular purpose in mind, and the data collected are used to answer that question. Sharing makes it possible for those same data to be repurposed to address questions not thought of by those who originally generated it. A perhaps more common form of repurposing is a secondary analysis that grows out of the original study, such as testing an additional hypothesis or providing further insight into a particular result. Such analyses can increase or decrease the scientific impact of the study, and so are important to perform. They are often the types of questions that can arise during the review of a manuscript, where curious reviewers might ask that additional analyses be included prior to publication. Once published, a reader has to query the author in the hope that the analysis was run. If the data are publically available, the author would not have to be bothered and the reader would be free to answer the question to her satisfaction as well as pursue others. An example of each type of repurposing in cognitive science can be found in a recent study in decision making. Erev et al. (2010) collected data in three monetary gamble tasks and made the data available to other researchers in the form of a modeling competition aimed at brainstorming on theory development and promoting quantitative modeling. More than a dozen teams conducted secondary analyses of the shared data, either by using existing models or by introducing a modeling framework new to the topic (e.g., Gonzalez & Dutt, 2011). After analyzing the shared data, some researchers (e.g., Abdellaoui, L’Haridon, & Paraschiv, 2011; Camilleri & Newell, 2011) designed follow-up experiments to test new hypotheses that grew out of the original study. These are clear instances in which data sharing accelerated multiple discoveries. Another type of secondary analysis that data sharing greatly facilitates is meta-analysis (Vickers, 2006). After a paradigm has been used or a phenomenon has been studied for a while, it can be desirable to integrate data across multiple experiments to evaluate the reliability of findings and obtain more accurate estimates of population parameters and effect sizes. Meta-analyses are a relatively straightforward means of providing such information (Schmidt, 1992). Studies involving data aggregation in this manner are not common in cognitive science but would surely benefit the study of mind. They would be trivial to perform if the data were easily accessible. Data sharing can also contribute to science education, especially training undergraduate and graduate students in courses in statistics and research methods (Whitlock, 2011). Students can be directed to published data sets on a topic of interest and have the opportunity to learn to reproduce analyses in a publication. Researchers themselves could benefit from the availability of such data sets when learning new statistical and modeling techniques. This also extends to the development of new statistical methodologies. Ready access to multiple data sets that share the same properties would aid developers in evaluating the robustness and applicability of new methods.Piwowar et al. (2011) suggest that data reuse is sensible financially. Reuse decreases the cost of research for the whole community by reducing the cost of each experiment, whether measured in federal funding dollars or in time and lab resources (e.g., equipment, participants) required for replication. Although there are clearly occasions when it is wisest to initiate a study by first replicating a past result, this is not always the case. Reuse is especially attractive when expensive technologies such as imaging are required for replication (Yarkoni, Poldrack, Essen, & Wager, 2010). What is the best way to share data? Some researchers place data on their personal websites, but this method of sharing suffers from two problems: permanency and discoverability. Researchers are tasked with ensuring links are always valid, which is likely a low priority, and broken links are not uncommon because of changes in an institution’s network infrastructure or relocation due to employment. Who maintains the site after the researcher has retired? The use of a personal website also reduces the visibility of the data because it can be found only by visiting the researcher’s site. Archiving data in an online repository frees researchers from the hassles of maintenance while also increases its discoverability (Vision, 2010). Repositories are libraries of data sets, and becoming the standard method of data storage across disciplines. Like libraries, their contents can be indexed along multiple dimensions so that users can not only locate the data set that led them to the repository but also browse (un)related data sets. Repositories range from barebones versions in which the data are listed only with the accompanying manuscript, much like a personal website (e.g., American Economics Review) to those with significant curation (e.g., ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and datadryad.org), which have more advanced search capabilities and provide additional content that can enhance the user experience. Two recent events are likely to accelerate sharing via repositories. Datacite’s (datacite. org) digital object identifier (DOI) for data sets has become an ISO standard, opening the way for the adoption of a single convention for a persistent link to a data set. Thomson Reuters has just launched the Data Citation Index, which will make it possible to track the reuse of data sets, thereby providing those who collected the data with appropriate recognition. It will also link articles listed in its Web of Knowledge directly to the corresponding data sets in accredited repositories (using the Datacite DOI). Finally, it would make sense that a data repository in cognitive science would house cognitive models as well (e.g., cmr.osu.edu), as modeling is central to the science. To achieve the functionality that Addyman and French (2012) desire, the modeling section of a repository could be designed after www.runmycode.org, a new economics modeling website that affords varying levels of interactivity, from merely depositing code to creating a web page on which simulations could be run. In summary, data sharing has scientific, public policy, and pedagogical value. It is promoted by national research organizations, public and private, and some societies and journals because they recognize that greater openness leads to a better and a more cumulative science. p. 216f",,yes

The workshop participants concluded that this mismatch of skills and resources is one important reason that existing data sets are underexploited. At the same time too much theoretical expertise is spent on models that are not guided by data and often only of limited relevance to neuroscience. Thus, the desirable and most optimal resource allocation in neuroscience is to enlist more theorists with varied theoretical skills in analyzing and modeling experimental data sets. Public sharing of experi- mental data would offer the fastest and most flexible interface for organizing and optimizing this “resource allocation.” First, it allows theorists to shift towards working on real data.

If data are to be archived at the investigator’s home institution, appro- priate space and staffing requirements must be met. Most funders permit these costs to be included in the proposal budget.  Confidentiality: The IRB needs to know about reidentification issues and whether the proposed restrict- ed data or restricted access arrangements will reduce dis- closure risk to an acceptable level. If this determination is beyond the expertise of IRB members, the IRB should consult with someone who is qualified to provide advice on this matter, such as a statistician who is knowledge- able about statistical disclosure limitation methods. Informed Consent. If data sharing plans have been developed responsibly to minimize the possibility that any subjects could be identified or reidentified, then, according to federal human research regulations (the Common Rule), the data are not human subjects data, and subjects’ permission need not be obtained for shar- ing. Some projects let research participants know that the data will be released in aggregated or deidentified form, even though this is not a legal requirement. The decision to include such a statement might depend on the nature of the project, the likelihood that the subjects will understand the statement, and on the feasibility of adding length to the informed consent statement.",,,yes
Combe 2008,2008,Observations on the UK transformational government strategy relative to citizen data sharing and privacy,"Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy","Privacy, Communication technologies, Government policy, Data security, Schools, United Kingdom",General review,"Purpose – One of the key aims of the UK’s Transformational Government strategy is to create a “joined-up” government where communications within and between public organisations is improved by the use of information technology. Data sharing is a key enabler of “joined-up” government but the implementation of the strategy presents a series of risks. The purpose of this paper is to articulate and assess the nature of those risks in relation to violations of existing laws using the National Pupil Database (NPD) in England as a case study. Design/methodology/approach – The paper investigates examples of violations of EU law relating to rights to privacy of data sharing practices within the UK public sector using an interpretive approach to existing published information. The case of the NPD illustrates how certain identified data sharing practices contravene existing laws and exposes this aspect of the Transformational Government strategy to heightened risk of a legal challenge. Findings – Four examples of violations of existing EU laws on privacy are identified from an investigation into the NPD for schools in England. The analysis exposes the imbalance between the data sharing practices underpinning the Transformational Government strategy in the UK and the requirements for fulfilling privacy protection rights to citizens enshrined in EU law. The findings reveal that data sharing practices as a key enabler of the Transformational Government strategy risks violating existing laws designed to protect privacy. The UK government risks a legal challenge, the outcome of which may seriously undermine the prospects for achieving the stated aim of improving efficiency and effectiveness across the public sector. Research limitations/implications – The paper is largely restricted to the NPD for schools in England. The findings would be strengthened by expanding the research into other areas of the public sector where data sharing practices have been implemented. Originality/value – The findings are a significant and timely contribution to understanding the data sharing/privacy tension that ministers and legislators need to address. The work provides an insight into where weaknesses exist within current arrangements that is of value to policymakers, legislators, human rights advocates and government authorities at both central and local levels.",Emerald,,,,,,,,no

A relatively large amount of information is available to enhance social inclusion but this data does not always have the detail (granularity) required to investigate small areas.

Legal and ethical issues associated with sharing locally generated information are frequently per- ceived as problematical. Examples of methods and protocols to overcome these problems are reviewed. It is possible that the activities of the Cabinet Office Committee on data sharing (MISC31) will act as an incentive for data sharing.

It is our view that data from individuals ineligible to participate in clinical trials can be shared with pharmaceutical company partners provided the consent form disclosed that the information would be shared with the company. p. 18

Consider two possible scenarios. In the first, an audit reveals that a consent form is missing or unsigned. In that case, consent to share information with the company cannot be confirmed, and therefore, the data cannot be ethically shared. In the second case, the consent documentation is inadequate rather than absent. For example, the signed consent form is not dated, or the witness signature is missing. In this circum stance, there appears to be evidence that the subject understood and agreed to the data-sharing plan with the company. While the documentation problems are impor tant, they do not compromise the subject's consent to share information with the company. Therefore, it is appropriate to share these individuals' data with the company, as they have already consented to doing so. p. 19

Data-sharing has become a powerful and promising direction in e-Science in general, even though fraught with difficulties. Sweden has a unique position in relation todata-sharing: a world-unique set of social science and medical data collections, a well established tradition of regulations concerning data protection, a widely used form of personal identification that allows integration of databases, and a population that generally trusts researchers and the Swedish state with personal data. The aim of this study was to find out how Swedish database owners/managers and database users – key actors in the Swedish e-Science enterprise – anticipate the way that databases will be built up, managed and used in the future, and how this will influence e-Science. For this purpose, these actors were interviewed and official documents on the topic were studied.

Thus the collection, storage, use and sharing of data about individuals have for some time been governed by laws and regulations to varying degrees in different countries. p. 214

The laws and regulations are there in order to protect information that can be linked to individuals from being seen and used by others and by authorities and commercial organizations in ways that could be perceived by the individual as intrusive or damaging. p. 215

From a technical point of view, storing large amounts of data, and having a large number of distributed users of that data, does not present a problem. From social, ethical and legal points of view, however, there are many problems still to be resolved. First of all, there are general problems that apply to all scientific disciplines regardless of the kind of data being shared, i.e. problems that have to do with how research is conducted and the crucial role of data in that process. To most researchers, external research funding is indispensable in research; the results and scientific publications arising from them, in turn, are the preconditions for future funding and future research. In the light of this, one can readily see that sharing data with other researchers is almost like giving away money, merit and future possibilities of the same, which may be seen as a problem by many researchers. To some extent, however, this could be compensated in an arrangement by which the data-users acknowledge the data-collectors. Another general problem is in ensuring that the quality of the data is maintained even after having been shared; that is, after having left the initial data-collector (Carlson and Anderson, 2007). Afurther issue may involve solutions such as thorough and controlled documentation, wellestablished standards, well-suited training and reliable services for researchers. This relates to another general issue, which is how research data can be made available for re-use in the first place; this involves digitizing non-digital materials (Carlson and Anderson, 2007), maintaining data over long periods of time and using the data for purposes other than the original within and outside the borders of a nation (Borgman, 2007). Then there are discipline-specific issues; that is, issues relating only to research dealing with data about humans pertains to how the integrity of personal data should be protected when made available to a large and unknown number of users. This is partly a technical question of how data can be securely stored in and retrieved from databases, but has also to do with the morals of researchers, what they do with the data once in their possession. p. 217

In some respects, the problems of data-sharing are not unique to e-enabled data, but rather relate to research collaboration in general. Intellectual Property (IP) issues, security issues (especially relating to sensitive data), data-formatting (data curation, metadata creation), the need for training and support for database researchers in their use of databases, and the like, all occur whenever data are shared. Nevertheless, as one interviewee stated: ‘Qualitatively there will not be any differences, but quantitatively’ (Database funder and database researcher). Put differently, the more users, or the more distributed users and unknown users, the more problems can be expected. p. 218

Several incidents in relation to research on Swedish data registers and data-sharing indicate that the public’s trust, in the state and in researchers, is fragile and could readily be destroyed, and that it would take years to re-construct that confidence. Significantly, the two main overarching issues that the interviewees in this study stressed were openness and safety. Openness with what researchers are up to, to the public and within the scientific community, and the safety of – or protection of – individuals who contribute with information about themselves to the data registers. Like all science, e-Science depends on the data to analyse; the difference is that in e-Science the numbers of data points and users are much larger. However, if Swedish database researchers, database managers and database funders take the demand for openness and integrity protection seriously, and as a joint challenge already now, in the process of scaling up the quantity of – and accessibility to – data with e-Science, then there will be few obstacles for Swedish database research in the future. However, if the Swedish e-Science enterprise pushes ahead too quickly and starts making data gathered from the public accessible to wider groups of researchers too soon, then Swedish e-Science may encounter a number of challenges. p. 223","Trust: A very important precondition for database research is public trust in the data collectors. If the public distrusts researchers or other data collectors (like the state) and denies them information about themselves, little database research could be carried out. However, the public has much to gain from research based on information about themselves. Better medical care, a better educational system and better solutions of social and economic problems are some of the societal benefits of database research. In Sweden, it seems that individuals have long trusted the data authorities with information about themselves. As described above, Sweden has a world-unique set of data registers about its population and the widely spread national identification number has been in use for 50 years. p. 218

Apart from issues of trust and privacy in society, our interviewees anticipated a number of specific issues on the creation of shared databases that would need to be addressed. One was the relevant expertise: To have someone from the outside to advise us when managing our database would be very valuable, in order to configure it for future e-Science uses that we do not have knowledge about today. (Database manager and database researcher) Perhaps Sweden has come relatively late to e-Science, or perhaps this researcher believes that other e-Science efforts are more advanced than is warranted. Other issues have been recognized elsewhere, such as the short funding cycles, which may mean that databases do not come into widespread use, or focus on new data rather than re-using it: People move in and out of studies. What is it that ensures the continuity of a database? Alot of existing databases are of high quality, but have fallen into oblivion. That is a waste of resources. But the research funding system tends to reward collecting data above using already collected data. (Database manager and database researcher) Developing shared data sets and repositories is not necessarily to do with e-Science, but with being able to have access to linked resources without needing to be a specialist in particular tools: For me [as a database researcher] the most important thing is to be able to put forward my research questions and link different databases. I should not have to know how databases are constructed or anything about e-Science to use the tools. That is the real challenge. (Database funder and database researcher) p. 222","This change from small scale to large scale and local to global is having major implications for research in changing both the pace and the nature of the research process. Not only can research activities such as data-collection, data-analysis, data-visualization and publication of research results be carried out much more quickly, thus allowing more scientific studies, they can be carried out in new and innovative ways. Advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) and grid technologies, to mention just a couple of examples, have made it possible for researchers to collect, store and analyse vast amounts of data, e.g. gene sequences (Gibbons et al., 2007); to analyse different formats of data simultaneously (e.g. video, audio and text) (Crabtree et al., 2006); to make data (and research results) available to other researchers (see, for example, www.hapmap.org); and to make research findings transparent for experts, decision-makers and the general public (Heldal, 2007). p. 214

Data-sharing means a larger amount of data available to the individual researcher, which, from a scientific point of view, is a positive thing. As Vickers (2006) points out, most research activities, for example replication of analyses, development of statistical methods, metaanalyses and teaching, can benefit from data-sharing. From the research funding agencies’ points of view, data-sharing can be seen as a way of getting better value for the money spent. In the end, research is about knowledge-creation, which at some point should reach society and benefit its citizens by providing better medicines and treatments, better schools, better political systems, and the like. p. 216

As Borgman (2005: 21) points out, natural science data have a low degree of sensitivity, since they describe natural phenomena, while data within the social sciences and medicine have a high degree of sensitivity since they describe humans. There are other differences between disciplines too in relation to data and data-sharing, says Borgman. p. 216","However, several of our interviewees mentioned the risk of journalists or other members of
the public who might obtain sensitive information and misuse it, especially about famous
people, and thus threaten trust and the possibilities for collecting data in the future.",yes

Humphrey 2003,2003,On the Advantages of Freely Accessible Data, Epidemiology,---,Letter,---,JSTOR,Library Science,,,"Hidden costs: First, you suggest that “free” information has a hidden cost. Specifically, every researcher has the same access to public data without knowing how others will analyze it. Your point is that researchers may duplicate efforts in analyzing freely available data. However, one need not venture too far to see how your “hidden-cost” premise becomes grounds for restricting “free” data. In other words, limit the researchers who have equal access to the same data and you will avoid duplication",,"This narrow perspective negates the importance of replicating analyses within the same data collection. Validating the findings of other researchers may be important for reasons beyond publishing research outcomes. For example, funding agencies may find such replications valuable in assessing outcomes. Such replications may facilitate the discovery process leading to new research. Furthermore, the replication of findings within a data collection may be derived using different analytic techniques. This might warrant publication for methodologic reasons, if not for substantive ones. By censoring this type of replication, you are suggesting that these analyses are an outright waste. p. 381

Two long-standing practices that restrict access to data, and against which the data archiving community has been battling for years, are the hoarding of data—simply not sharing data among researchers—and the selling of data only to those who can afford access. These practices are barriers to good science and pose an enormous cost to research. Rather than being detractors of “free” data, you should be strong proponents of publicly accessible data. Furthermore, you hint that sharing data has serious consequences without explicitly naming any costs, eg, “There are perplexing and far-reaching questions being raised by the movement to encourage data sharing.”1(p.496) I believe that the costs of not sharing data are greater to science than the burden on any individual investigator to share her or his research data. Secondly, you suggest that “epidemiologists are thrown into a new game”1(p.495) when using publicly accessible data. This position subtly promotes original data collection as the preferred method. Duplicating an analysis of the same data can be avoided if researchers collect and analyze their own original data. This premise, however, presumes that researchers can afford to collect the equivalent data found in a voluminous and high-quality public data collection such as NHANES. If there ever would be a waste of researchers’ time, effort and resources, it would be in attempting to replicate the collection of NHANES. p. 381

Cooper 2007,2007,Sharing Data and Results in Ethnographic Research: Why This Should not be an Ethical Imperative,Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics,ethnographic research; data sharing; results sharing; disclosure; ethics boards; IRB,Journal paper,"RESEARCHERS RECENTLY HAVE argued that offering to share research results with study participants should be an ""ethical imperative."" This article considers that suggestion in light of the practice of ethnographic, particularly anthropological, research. Sharing results is discussed in relation to several issues, e.g., whether it occurs during or after completion of a project, whether the research is long-term, the complexities involved in depositing field materials in archives, the changing politics of ethnographic research, research not concerned with communities, situations in which participants and the anthropologist may be in danger, and changing styles of ethnographic research. I argue that, ideally, sharing should be a regular component of ethnographic research but should not be an ethical requirement. Given the complexity, variety and changing political contexts of ethnographic research, implementing such a requirement would often be practically impossible and sometimes would be inadvisable. I recommend instead that research ethics boards educate themselves about the nature of ethnographic research. Further, they should approach decision making on the issue of data or results sharing on a case-by-case basis. For researchers, I recommend that discussion of data and result sharing should become part of the education of all ethnographers and that discussion of the issue should be fostered.",JSTOR,Ethnography,Data-sharing in ethnographic research,,"Privacy: The injunction to offer to return research results is grounded in the principle of respect for persons (Fernandez, Kodish, & Weijer, 2003). Fernandez and associates have argued that this widely-accepted princi- ple should be extended beyond its usual application, informed consent, to “informing subjects of research results at the conclusion of the study” (Fernandez, Kodish, & Weijer, 2003, p. 12). As well, they have argued that “[P]articipants (or communities for that matter) have the prerogative to reject the offer but should do so in the context of an informed decision about the risks and benefits of receiving information”. That is, “the partic- ipant is in the best moral position to make that deci- sion—not the researcher imposing his or her opinion on that participant” (Fernandez, personal communica- tion). I find their argument very attractive, however, I do not think that it adequately serves as a basis for addressing the complexities of the issue in the context of ethnographic research practices. p. 6

Raw field notes are not generally shared directly with study participants but they may become available to them otherwise. As Chambers et al. (2002, p. 211) argue, “[F]ield notes, recordings, genealogies, journals, interviews . ..are complex ethnographic artifacts. We now understand that they have been produced through an interplay between numerous actors and interests ...”They represent not only community life but also the intellectual and personal development of the researcher. Thus, “questions of ownership, access, and control multiply” (Chambers et al., 2002, p. 212). However, in many cases today such “ethnographic artefacts” are deposited in archives where researchers and others can consult them. p. 10

Dona Davis (1993) returned interview mate- rials and portions of her book to the people with whom she worked in Newfoundland for their com- ments and approval. None objected to what she wrote so long as she preserved confidentiality and anonymity. However, she learned when she returned to the com- munity years later for further research that regardless of her having disguised identities, local women could easily identify people she had written about. Rumours began to circulate about her and the book (mainly among people who had not read it) with the result that some people refused interviews with her and some refused to have her in their homes. [...] As Tolich (2004) suggests, while researchers may be able to provide assurances of “external confidentiality”, “internal confidentiality” is often much more difficult to ensure, with potentially harmful consequences both for researchers and par- ticipants. Nonetheless, providing publications to par- ticipants clearly should be an integral part of all ethnographic research as it recognizes participants’ integral role in the production of ethnographic knowledge.p. 11","What is the larger context within which sharing occurs or does not, e.g., in situations of violent conflict? Another set of dimensions has to do with the actual nature and extent of the sharing. What is it that is shared/returned/disclosed, e.g., transcripts of interviews, raw field notes, genealogical data, edited data, interpretations, or publications? With whom are the results shared, e.g., individuals who were interviewed, assistants and/or local consultants, community lead- ers, community, government or national organiza- tions? Another very important issue concerns who makes decisions (i.e., who has the power to decide) about the sharing of research,—the researcher(s) alone, participants, or the researcher in consultation with participants? p. 8

Many of the issues regarding data availability can be addressed if the principles of “publication” rather than “sharing” are applied. However, online data publication systems also need to develop mechanisms for data citation and indices of data access comparable to those for citation systems in print journals.",JSTOR,Biology,,Expert interviews (article has no method section),"""The main problem in data availability is not a lack of policy, technology, financial resources, or publication outlets, although data centers do need financial support (Merali and Giles 2005). Rather, it is that the science reward system has not kept pace with the new opportunities provided by the Inter- net, and does not sufficiently recognize online data publica- tion."" (p.426)

""The main obstacle to making more primary scientific data available is not policy or money but misun- derstandings and inertia within parts of the scientific com- munity."" (p.419)

People will copy my work from the Web and plagiarize it.: The unconventional nature and ease of copying electronic media make some scientists uncomfortable about online publications. Most print-based science journals are now available online, so the potential of copying is already present. By publishing the data, the source will be widely apparent to the scientific community, and thus plagiarism is more likely to be discovered. p. 421

Where can one publish data? Journals will not publish primary raw data. An increasing number of (and most of the top) journals publish online appendices that can include primary data. In addition, data centers will archive and make publicly available an increasing range of biological and environmental data. p. 421

Possesion: It is my data—why should I make it available?
In most cases, the scientist is the custodian of data either owned by their employer organization, or, if the data collection was paid for with public
funds, then the data should belong to society. Unfortunately, some scientists believe they personally own data even though their salaries and
research are funded by their employer or government sources. Most scientists are stewards of public data, and have a responsibility for its
dissemination. p. 421

Posession: The data I used were not my own and I did not get permission to publish them. If the data owner provided the data to the scientist, it is possible that they would provide permission to publish it. The question is, then, why did not, or will not, the scientist ask for such permission? Perhaps because they see no personal benefit in that, it will take time from more profitable activities, or they feel no ethical obligation to make data access convenient to others. 

Competition: If I release data, then I may be scooped by somebody else producing papers from them. I have not finished analyzing the data and I may do further analysis on them. In many cases it may be valid to delay publication of data until they have been analyzed and the synthesis published. However, the data should be published before or upon release of the first print publication so their location can be cited. If no publications transpire after 12 months (the convention in astronomy; RIN 2008), then that likelihood decreases in time and it may benefit the scientist more to publish the data so as to obtain some credit for his or her work. 

Competition: Somebody will use my data and benefit from such use, and worse still, they may be a commercial organization or consultant. Scientists want people to benefit from the results of their research when published in print media, and should have the same hopes when publishing data. As with print media, once published, authors have no control over who may use their findings for whatever purpose, and it may be a waste of energy to attempt to do so. Generally, scientists welcome all use and citation of their research in print media, even by competitors and the popular press, so why should they deny such use of data? 

Giving up power: The publisher may profit. Scientists commonly sign away copyright to for-profit print media publishers. In contrast, most data publication is by government-funded or not-for-profit organizations. If they benefit from the data publication, they will probably reinvest the funds in the same enterprise. 

Giving up control: I fear that the data will be used for an incorrect purpose. Data sets should be published only with sufficient “metadata” or documentation that describes how they were collected and their limitations. Should this be provided, then, as with print publications, it is up to the users of the data to be sufficiently competent to use and interpret them. 

Skills: I do not have the skills to publish data on the Internet. Anybody who has the skills to manage their data in tables and spreadsheets has sufficient skill to provide such data in a standard format to organizations that will publish data on the Internet. 

International barriers: Intellectual property rights related to data and databases differ between countries. Another concern is loss of intellectual property rights (IPR), ownership, authorship, or control of data by making them available. This encourages comparisons between countries of different IPR laws related to data, databases, and publications. The resulting complexity of issues further discourages data sharing. However, this seems unnecessary if data publication is considered in the same manner as a print publication. Such issues do not significantly limit publication in print media, and neither should they on the Internet. The IPR model of some data publication organizations that regularly crawl data sets distributed at many sources is that copyright and ownership stay with the data source. Thus online publication can give data custodians greater control over data publication than can conventional print media. 

No countervalue: I will not get due recognition for creating the data. Publication is the most certain way that scientists can get public credit for their ideas and work. Similarly, the best way to ensure recognition for collecting useful data is by publishing them. Science will benefit most if data are published under “open content” policy as described in the Creative Commons licensing agreements. A common requirement of users is attribution of the source, including its authors or editors. If data users clearly cite their sources, as they would for print publications, it adds credibility to the data so used. If authors do not cite data sources, then, as in print media, they may be guilty of plagiarism. 

12. Other reasons. As with the print publication process, data publication can expose problems with data and improve its quality. Sometimes data is organized in an idiosyncratic manner that would make it difficult for anybody else to analyze. Rows and columns in tables may not be adequately labeled, consistently formatted, or sufficiently described for other users. Authors may fear that their selective use of data, or possible errors in analysis, may be revealed by data publication. However, exposure of data to independent analysis would benefit science by either providing independent support or further refinement of the originator’s conclusions, or alternative interpretations.","""primary motivations for individual scientists to publish in print are to demonstrate their contribution to science, and the consequent peer-recognition that influences one’s reputation and employment opportunities, promotion at work, and ability to win further research funding."" p. 422

 There is a precedent for this failure to cite the original source. The publications that describe new species are rarely cited when the species are mentioned in subsequent studies. Indeed, even the practice of citing identification guides and sources of species nomenclature in scientific publications seems to have waned (Agnarsson and Kunter 2007). If they were cited, taxonomic papers, revisions, and identification guides would be among the most highly cited publications, and they would have very long citation lives (Minelli 2003). To better recognize the contributions of taxonomists to science, different metrics are required, such as how often a species name is used both overall and in particular fields of study, such as agriculture or genetics. p. 422

The increased interoperability and linking between online resources can mean that data may be visible from several locations. The original source of data should be the basis for citation. To facilitate citation, data centers should track data access using automated tools and should display the results on their Web site (Costello and Vanden Berghe 2006, Blagoderov et al. 2008, Heidorn 2008, Roberts et al. 2008); that is, an index should be maintained that tracks data viewed, searched, downloaded, linked to, or cited. p. 422

Parr 2007,2007,Open Sourcing Ecological Data,BioScience,---,Viewpoint,"In a thought-provoking Viewpoint,Cassey and Blackburn (2006) suggestthat
 reproducibility should not be re-quired of ecological studies. Thus, 
eco-logical journals should not requireauthors to publish data as a 
requirementof publication, nor should reviewers in-sist on it. Cassey 
and Blackburn makethree cautionary points: First, the goal 
ofreproducibility should not be appliedpiecemeal. Second, journals are 
not readyfor custodianship of  data. Third, pub-lishing data places the 
intellectual rightsof authors at risk under the current re-ward system. I
 will respond to each ofthese points, then end with another viewof the 
future of ecological research: anopen-source web of ecological data",JSTOR,Ecology,"Data-sharing in academic research (short bits on data-sharing by corporations); 
viewpoint, ecological data",,,"When these choices are coupled with a changed reward system,as de- scribed below,the most effective stan- dards,policies,and protocols can emerge in a Darwinian process.Just as there is no universally successful suite ofadaptations, there will never be a perfect set of standards,protocols,and software to be applied to all science. p. 309

My suggestion is that each journal cre- ate a consistent policy about where,how, and when the data associated with its publications must be archived.Until clear community standards emerge,journals should provide a wide range ofalterna- tives from which authors can choose. Authors and their institutions can there- fore “vote with their data”(and,indeed, their manuscripts) and begin to influ- ence which repositories,standards,tools, and policies become the community standards. p. 309

Informatics studies are often highly collaborative.Most likely the best people for such collaborations are the ones who have the deepest understanding ofhow data were collected and previously ana- lyzed.Given a choice between someone who has already made data available in formats that you can see are likely to be useful, and someone who privately main- tains data in unknown formats,whom would you choose as a collaborator? p. 310

Yet the publish-or-perish reward sys- tem is already changing in ways that fa- vor data sharing.Currently,authorship is considered paramount,particularly in journals with high impact factors based on overall journal citation rates.But a measure ofindividual researcher impact has recently been proposed (Hirsch 2005). This “H index”takes into account the number ofcitations the author’s pa- pers have received,data that are now publicly available at Google Scholar.Al- though the question ofhow best to com- pute such an index is still controversial and beyond the scope ofthis essay,we now have the means to objectively and easily evaluate individual impact. I believe that journals should make it easier to cite data by allowing extended online citations; that journals must en- force rich data citation;and that em- ployers and funding agencies should use such citations in evaluating researcher performance p. 310

Not everyone must take an open- source approach to data sharing.In the world ofsoftware,both private and open- source models appear to be sustainable, and many ofus take advantage ofboth in our personal and professional lives.There is growing interest in using the Semantic Web as a framework for exchange ofdata; p. 310
","Transparency and verifiability in politi- cally sensitive research areas (global cli- mate change,conservation biology,etc.) are in the best interests ofscientists and society.Controversy over phylogenetic reconstruction methods has led to the expectation that character data be pub- lished so they can be reanalyzed.Con- flicting studies that bear on human health are subjected to meta-analyses using pooled data, ifavailable.Research bear- ing on ecosystem health should be treated similarly. p. 309

Even ifpublished data are not neces- sary for evaluation ofa specific study or research question,the potential value of data to the community can be a sufficient reason to require their publication.Ecol- ogists should not be subject to a standard lower than that for life scientists in ge- nomics and medicine. p. 309

uses of data have already advanced the science ofecology,as synthetic studies increasingly produce knowledge on scales not previously possible. p. 310

Cassey and Blackburn (2006) express concern that journals are not ready to be custodians oforiginal data.Larger publishers (e.g., Ecology,Science,Nature) already archive data and supplemental material,largely in flat formats;such data may not be the most easily found or used, but there is significant value in their likely longevity.Still,journals need not be data custodians,nor is a universal protocol, framework,or intellectual property pol- icy necessary.Other long-term reposi- tories and registries are maintained by universities,government agencies,and other institutions that are already work- ing with the scientific community to de- velop standards and protocols (Parr and Cummings 2005,Jones et al.2006). p. 309

Tracking data citations will also allow us to judge the effectiveness of alternative data archives and methods. p. 310

In a self-fulfilling prophecy,ecology journals have notoriously low impact factors,perhaps in part because more emphasis has been placed on new data collection than on the integration ofold data into more modern analyses. p. 310",You receive little credit ifan author can say only “Smith (unpublished data).”You may not be individually credited ifyour data are part ofa large database that gets cited.A mention in the acknowledgments is currently only ofminor benefit. p. 310,yes

The current approach is confused. On the one hand, there is a perception in the research community that the principle of respecting confidentiality is a major impediment to good quality research. For example, as a result of the requirement to seek consent to identify individuals for potential enrolment in research—what has been called “consent for consent”—improvements in health care and technology are said to be withering on the vine.

Future courses will include previous training material plus education in research applications, basic database concepts, schemas, metadata collection, network technologies, and the technical architecture behind the resources. These workshops will help spread the knowledge necessary to more effectively maintain and grow our networks, thus greatly alleviating expertise bottlenecks, and will provide a much-needed but currently unavailable program in biodiversity informatics education.

Most attention focuses on databases as a large-scale means of communicating research, but they can also be used on a much smaller scale as research tools. This paper presents an ethnographic study of the development of a mouse genome mapping resource organized around a database. Through an examination of the natural, social and digital orderings that arise in the construction of the resource, it argues that the use of databases in science, at least in this kind of project, is unlikely to produce wholesale change. Such changes as do occur in work practices, communication regimes and knowledge outcomes are dependent on the orderings that each database embodies and is embedded within. Instead of imposing its own computer logic, the database provides a focus for specifying and tying together particular natural and social orderings. The database does not act as an independent agent of change, but is an emergent structure that needs to be embedded in an appropriate set of work practices.",JSTOR,,,,,,,,no
Huang et al. 2013,2013,Biodiversity Data Sharing: Will Peer-Reviewed Data Papers Work?,BioScience,---,Viewpoint,---,JSTOR,Biodiversity,primary biodiversity data,survey,"The respondents claimed a weak culture of sharing within their scientific community (Figure 1b). African respondents reported the weakest climate of data sharing: they constituted the lowest percentage (5.9%, n = 1) of respondents who thought their colleagues wished to share data (χ2 = 18.51; P = 0.002) and the highest percentage (64.7%, n = 11) who thought their colleagues were ignorant about data sharing (χ2 = 19.65; P = 0.002). Europe ranked lowest for encouragement of data sharing by employers and funders (19.4%, n = 24; χ2 = 12.49; P = 0.03). However, the respondents whose affiliations and funding agencies encourage data sharing were more willing to share (Table S4). p. 401

Approximately half of the respondents preferred keeping primary data private beyond their first publication to conduct other analyses. A similar number of respondents indicated other obstacles to biodiversity data sharing, including conflicts of interests with colleagues (27.1%), lack of benefits (21.2%), weak sharing culture (28.8%), unfamiliarity with public databases (29.1%), and lack of user-friendly data submission tools (32.1%; Figure 1c). Many respondents voiced further concerns in their comments. For example, about 40% of the comments expressed a lack of time and funding to properly format, input, update, and otherwise manage their publicly available data. p. 401

When asked what benefits they expected from sharing data, nearly 90% (88.5%, n = 322) of respondents indicated the desire to contribute to scientific progress. More than one-third wanted credit (37.1%, n = 135) and higher citation rates (33.5%, n = 122). p. 401

Of the respondents who answered the question about established databases, over half knew of GBIF and EoL, more than one-third knew ofWikiSpecies (http://species. wikimedia.org/) and Species2000 (http://www.sp2000.org/), and relatively few knew of Dyrad (http:// datadryad.org/) and DataOne (https://www.dataone. org/; Figure 2a). Over three quarters (76.6%, n = 281) of respondents agreed that a small number of unified biodiversity databases using standard data format are needed. More than half (56.3%) thought GBIF best p.402

Respondents were asked whether a journal’s data archiving policy would influence their manuscript submission. Approximately one-fifth (21.3%) indicated that such a policy by a leading journal would influence them “very much,” whereas such a policy by a lower ranked journal would influence a smaller proportion of respondents “very much” (16.8%). A majority of respondents (at least 68.9% and 73.7% for leading and lower ranked journals) would accept journals’ data archiving policies (Figure 3a). When asked how long they would like to keep private their article-related data, 30% (30.4%) of respondents indicated they would prefer to keep their data private until they were completely finished with them. However, more respondents indicated that they would be willing tomake their data public as soon as related articles were published (38.6%) or after 1–3 years (Figure 3b). p. 403
Individual scientists are both data providers and data users during the research process. It is therefore critical that we understand what they are thinking and doing about sharing and archiving primary biodiversity data. To our knowledge, the results of this survey provide a first empirical view of these issues. p. 403

There seems to be a contradiction between two views: research data gathered with public funding should be made public, but the data gatherers deserve more benefits and better recognition for doing so. A major obstacle to sharing data revealed by our survey is researchers’ need for further analyses of their data. The other main obstacles include conflicts of interest with colleagues, lack of benefits, unfamiliarity with public databases, lack of user-friendly data submission tools, and insufficient time and funding. Some of these are common obstacles that other disciplines also face, as reported by a previous survey (Tenopir et al. 2011). In fact, barriers such as data retention for further analyses and conflicts of interest are directly related to the perceived benefits to the data sharers. p. 403

The present survey indicates that incentives such as receiving credit, coauthorship, and higher citation rates would encourage data sharing. The sharing of detailed research data may be associated with increased citation rates (Piwowar et al. 2007), but some respondents suggested data sharing be given greater weight in the assessment system for the professional productivity of researchers (see also Kueffer et al. 2011). As a possibility, statistics on the reuse or citation of publicly available data sets should be treated as are article citations. Recently, the development of a Data Usage Index has been proposed for improving the professional recognition in the biodiversity community (Ingwersen & Chavan 2011). In addition, we think data registry methods, for example an interoperable dataset identifier, can resolve data ownership or intellectual property rights and citation issues. Proper archiving methods and policies are necessary conditions to achieve the fundamental goal of sharing data. The survey results indicate a majority of respondents would accept data archiving policies by biodiversity and conservation journals (Huang & Qiao 2011; Whitlock 2011). They would prefer to make primary data public as soon as related articles are published or a short period of time thereafter. Many respondents consider that sharing the primary data supporting a publication is a simple ethical principle in science. There is also concern about the credibility of a article if the authors are reluctant to share their data. Although data archiving is routine for journals in some fields such as genetics, genomics, and biomedicine,many researchers still fail to publicly archive their data after publication (Noor et al. 2006; Alsheikh-Ali et al. 2011). p. 403

biodiversity databases should promote themselves and help improve researchers’ awareness of data sharing. Researchers expressed concerns about how to deal with their data easily and efficiently. The expectations for biodiversity databases included using standard formats, user-friendly submission tools, proper storage mechanisms for different types of biodiversity data, and collaboration between databases employing interchangeable data structures. Although many researchers agreed that a small number of unified databases are needed to effectively preserve biodiversity data, some also warn of oversimplifying data that is inherently complex. Database developers should address the concerns of data providers and data users to improve the usability and universality of biodiversity databases. In their In their comments, respondents also expressed concerns about data quality and reliability in public databases, taxonomic accuracy perhaps being the most important. Biodiversity databases should devise ways to resolve this problem (Page 2008; Patterson et al. 2010) and improve data management. The quality of data from journal articles can be partially guaranteed by rigorous data archiving policies. Theoretically, the quality of data from natural history collections and voucher specimens can be improved by continuous update by qualified taxonomic staff. However, insofar as the “taxonomic impediment” is a challenge to taxonomy as well as biodiversity science (Ebach et al. 2011). Strict joint data archiving policies by journals and databases and certain data standards would also help control data quality and preserve detailed metadata descriptions. p. 404

","More than 90% (91.8%, n = 338) of respondents agreed the sharing of biodiversity data is very important, 7.6% (n = 28) thought it of some importance, and two respondents thought it unimportant. Over 80% (84.3%, n = 311) of respondents agreed sharing article-related data is a basic responsibility, whereas 11.1% (n = 41) disagreed. A strong majority of respondents would be willing to share article-related data, but almost two-thirds would prefer not to share before publication (Figure 1a). p 401",,,no

This investigation fills notable gaps in the literature on science, including a lack of emphasis on larger sociopolitical structures, a neglect of regulation, and indifference toward ethics. The author focuses on the oversight of a particular research practice; data editing; which embodies qualities that are intriguing to sociologists of science: invisibility, uncertainty, heterogeneity, and reliance on tacit knowledge. These characteristics pose unique challenges to oversight efforts. An analysis of in-depth interviews with gatekeepers reveals that although the methodological and ethical implications of data editing strategies can be substantial, oversight of such practices falls outside the stages and domains of current gatekeeping activity. These findings serve as the basis for recommendations to ensure data integrity while maintaining the professional autonomy of researchers.",JSTOR,no particular discipline,not about data sharing in particular; but rather data management and ethics,qualitative interviews,"The way researchers edit their data can affect research findings, and if data edits are not reported or if they lend more support to researchers' hypotheses, ethical issues may also arise. In a recent medical study, half the data points were omitted from an analysis sample, and conclusions were drawn without mentioning that the conclusions are reversed when all data points are included (Shah 2002). In the social sciences, Peterson (1996) replicated Lenore Weitzman's (1985) analysis of the conse? quences of divorce for men and women and found that the gender gap in stan? dard of living was about half as large as Weitzman concluded. Kahn and Urdy (1986) also illustrated how data editing strategies can affect research findings by questioning the legitimacy of extremely high values in Jasso's (1985) study of coital frequency among married couples; their reanalysis completely reversed Jasso's finding that wife's age is positively related to a couple's sexual activity. Clearly, differences in managing and editing data can produce discrepant results and raise ethical concerns. p. 607

The ACT Study enrolled 2,581 people between 1994 and 1996 and another 811 in 2000–2001. Since 2005, participants have been continuously enrolled to maintain a cohort size of approximately 2,000 persons. ACT Study participants receive biennial examinations to determine cognitive status. p. 3; Survey","At one extreme, one could argue that the public good of unrestricted biorepository research outweighs the rights of individual participants to choose whether to participate when the research presents a minimal risk to participants (Bathe & McGuire, 2009; Helgesson, Dillner, Carlson, Bartram, & Hansson, 2007). At the other extreme, one could argue that the autonomy interests of the research participants requires obtaining express permission or some other precautions for additional procedures that the original consent process did not specify, including submission of data to dbGaP (Greely, 2007). For researchers, practicability is a key consideration, as approaching research participants for additional permission can be time consuming and expensive (Colditz, 2009). p. 2

Two polar ends of the policy spec trum are the restricted access approach and the open access approach. Both approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages. p. 1

The restricted access approach offers excellent protec tion for confidentiality, but it does so at the expense of potentially slowing the pace of scientific progress because investigators may find it difficult or burdensome to comply with the requirements for obtaining access to research data. p. 2

?; r nder the restricted access strate . gy, research data are shared only if the data recipients agree to specific terms and conditions. For example, the Framingham Heart Study?a prospective cohort study that now contains over 15,000 men and women from Framingham, Massachusetts?permits access to the research data only when certain conditions are met. Access is restricted to researchers who comply with requirements for use of the data, sign a data and materials use agreement, and have obtained insti tutional review board (IRB) approval for their study.9 Researchers are not allowed to iden tify the individuals from whom the data were obtained and may only use the data for research projects described in the signed agreement. They must take security measures to protect the use of electronic data, such as encryption and firewalls, and may not share the data with third parties. A committee reviews requests for access to data to ensure that the proposed research projects are well designed, scientifically important, and comply with the goals and standards of the Framingham Study.1 p. 2

The data may be coded or anonymized. If the data are coded, the researchers retain a code that links the data to specific individuals, but they do not share the code with people who request access to the data.11 If the data are anonymized, the researchers who collected the data have no method for linking the data to the individu als from whom the data were obtained. p. 2

1 dentify previously deidentified data, commentators have suggested several approaches to protecting the confidentiality of genomic research data. One approach is to limit the amount of genomic data that is pub licly released so that reidentification is not possible. There are two prob lems with this approach. First, there is no general formula for how much data to release, since how much is needed to identify an individual depends on the region of the genome, the rarity of variants, and other factors.25 Also, what can be safely released may change as science and technology advance. Second, releasing only a minimal amount of data may not provide researchers with what they need for genomic studies, therefore defeating the pur pose of public data release.26 Another approach is to statistically degrade the data to prevent reidenti fication of individuals. Like the first approach, this one would also com promise the usefulness of the data. third approach is for individu als who provide their DNA for research to consent to open release of their genomic data, with the knowledge that they can be or will be identified. Thus, they would relin quish traditional confidentiality pro tections in order to help promote biomedical research. p. 4

A fourth approach is the revised NIH policy for GWAS data, which involves moving from the open access model toward some type of restricted access to genomic data. This strategy can help to protect the confidentiality of individuals' genomic data and the confidentiality interests of their relatives. Though a restricted access model may impede or delay research by making it more difficult for some researchers to obtain access to data, these problems can be alleviated, in part, by devel oping policies that are not excessive ly restrictive; publicizing the avail ability of data; linking available p.5
",,"Even if the individual is not explicit ly identified it may be possible to use statistical methods to identify the individual and match him/her to a genetic database. A third method is to develop a profile of an individual from phenotypic and genetic data in databases, such as the individual's height, weight, gender, disease status, age, approximate skin pigmentation, eye color, and hair color [...] Access to aggregate GWAS data is now granted only to investigators and institutions that submit an appli cation to the data access committee and abide by the terms of the data use agreement. The NIH also urged other organizations to consider the policy implications of the recent developments indicating the ability to reidentify genomic  p. 4  

The risks of someone identifying an individual in aggregate, public genomic databases are extremely low at present because people are not likely to put forth the effort required to identify individuals. However, the risks of reidentification are likely to increase as science and technology advance and more identified data become available. Close family mem bers may be at risk as well because it may be possible to identify them and make inferences about their pheno types once an immediate genetic p. 4",yes

To honor its pledge to the respondents that their data will be kept confidential, but at the same time meet its objective of providing useful data to researchers, it has developed procedures for stripping sensitive information (i.e., information that could facil- itate re-identification of sample members) from data sets that are publicly released, and also for providing mechanisms for qualified researchers to gain access to a variety of restricted-access data files. These mecha- nisms include a procedure whereby highly qualified researchers—in particular, only those who have a cur- rent grant from a federal agency—can apply to obtain restricted-access data sets for a limited amount of time, with the understanding that they will make no attempt to re-identify sample members and that they will be audited to ensure that they have adhered to the agreedupon safeguards. For those who meet some but not all of the requirements for receiving these data, the files can be analyzed in a data enclave (a controlled, secure environment in which eligible researchers can perform analyses). This paper focuses on approaches to restrict- ing data access that may need to be considered by inves- tigators who plan to share their data, and by their insti- tutional officials who will need to support that effort with appropriate infrastructure and policies.

The institution with which the researcher is affiliated must have an institutional review board or human subjects review committee that is registered with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

4. RESTRICTED DATA PROTECTION PLAN The application for restricted data must include a data protection plan. Detailed guidelines for developing a restricted data protection plan are provided on the HRS website.4 Generally this means that the applicant will need to investigate the mechanisms that are available at the site(s) at which the restricted data will be managed, ana- lyzed, and stored to meet HRS requirements.
5. HUMAN SUBJECTS REVIEW The chairperson of the institutional review board/ human subjects review committee at the applicant’s institution must certify that the board/committee has reviewed and approved the restricted data protection plan and any portions of the research plan that deal with respondent anonymity and data security, as approved by the Institute for Social Research (ISR), in accordance with the standards and procedures used for human subjects. p. 98-90

Why restricted data release: 
1. Restricted data can be used only for research and sta- tistical purposes, and the research plan must specify all of the research projects that will make use of the restricted data. It is not permitted, for example, for a faculty member to obtain the data for his or her own research project and then “lend” it to a graduate stu- dent to do related dissertation research, even if the graduate student is a research staff signatory, unless this use is specifically stated in the research plan. 2. The researcher must either destroy, or return to HRS, all versions of the restricted data and data derived from it, regardless of the form in which it exists (tapes, hard disk, diskettes, and other physical media) within 24 months, or such other period as is specified in the approved research plan, or upon a demand from HRS. Researchers who need addition- al time should make a formal written request for an extension at least 30 days prior to the expiration date, and HRS will give prompt consideration to such requests. However, neither the initial time period, nor any extension of it, may exceed the time period of the grant or contract under which the data are being analyzed. One implication of the time limit is that the research should assure that adequate time is available to do the data management and planned analysis. In brief, the researcher may not retain any copies of, or data derived from, the restricted data, after the conclusion of the contract period. HRS staff will, on request, store the physical media con- taining such data for the researcher for up to two years, so that it can be returned to that researcher if he or she obtains a second agreement for further analysis. 3. The investigator seeking access to restricted data must be a person who is a current principal investi- gator or a co-principal investigator of a current fed- eral agency research grant or contract. 4. The investigator must be affiliated with the receiv- ing institution with a position or title equivalent to a permanent tenured or tenure-track faculty member. 5. All co-investigators and research staff must have a formal affiliation with the receiving institution, and must specify that affiliation and job title in the sig- nature blocks of the agreement and supplemental agreement of research staff. If new persons become affiliated with the research project and are to have access to the restricted data, an additional supple- mental agreement of research staff must be signed by the new persons and the restricted data investi- gator, and approved by HRS staff, before the new person is given access to the restricted data. HRS permits individuals who were not original principal investigators or co-principal investigators on current federal research grants or contracts to be added to such a project as a co-principal investiga- tor and to become co-investigators on agreements for the use of restricted data from HRS, provided the principal investigator of the federal grant or con- tract signs the agreement as the restricted data investigator, and HRS is provided a copy of the feder- al agency’swritten approval of the addition of the new co-principalinvestigator. (The National Institute on Aging has indicated a willingness to facilitate the addition of persons as co-principal Investigators to existing NIA grants and contracts for purposes of facilitating access to HRS restricted data sets.) 6. The investigator’s institution must agree to treat vio- lations of this agreement, and allegations of such violations, as violations and allegations of violations of its policies on scientific integrity and misconduct, as to substance, procedures, and penalties. 7. The representative of the investigator’s institution who signs the Agreement must have the authority to bind the institution contractually.",,,yes
Whitlock et al. 2010,2010,Data archiving is a good investment,The American Naturalist,---,Editorial,---,JSTOR,-,editorial on data curation,no method,,"data curation: The data should be saved usually at the individual level, although what is most important is that the data be saved in a way that makes the most sense for later usability. Summary statistics (like means and standard deviations) are not sufficient, because they wouldn’t provide enough information for later analysis. At the same time, data in their rawest form, such as videotapes, field notebooks, or sequencing trace files, are not required. For example, if a study used videotape to determine the time required for animals to make a choice in a T-maze, the data should be recorded with the time for each subject. p. 146","Yet these data, even after the main results for which they were collected are published, are invaluable to science, for meta-analysis, new uses, and quality control. With the increasing use of meta-analysis to summarize multiple studies, it has become clear that necessary summary statistics are often not published. In many cases, a study can be used only if the original data are available to the metaanalysts. Furthermore, data often can be used in ways beyond the questions that sparked their collection; for example, many studies contain information that can serve later as a baseline for detecting population trends, even decades later. The availability of data for published studies also allows error checking, making science more open and letting us more rapidly reach accurate conclusions. Finally, papers that have had data archived are more useful to— and more cited by—other scientists. One study found that papers that archived their data were cited 69% more often than papers that did not (Piwowar et al. 2007). p. 145",,yes
Zimmerman 2008,2008,New Knowledge from Old Data: The Role of Standards in the Sharing and Reuse of Ecological Data,"Science, Technology, & Human Values",ata sharing;data reuse; ecology; objectivity;standardization,Journal paper,"This article analyzes the experiences of ecologists who used data they did not collect themselves. Specifically, The author examines the processes by which ecologists understand and assess the quality of the data they reuse, and investigates the role that standard methods of data collection play in these processes. Standardization is one means by which scientific knowledge is transported from local to public spheres. While standards can be helpful, the results show that knowledge of the local context is critical to ecologists' reuse of data. Yet, this information is often left behind as data move from the private to the public world. The knowledge that ecologists acquire through fieldwork enables them to recover the local details that are so critical to their comprehension of data collected by others. Social processes also play a role in ecologists' efforts to judge the quality of data they reuse.",JSTOR,ecology,ecology,Semi-structured in-depth interviews,"Wherever they work, ecologists are confronted with variance among individuals within a population, with the unpredictable character of the natural environment, and with immensely complex systems with large numbers of variables and many subtle interactions. For example, even with a field guide and specimens in hand it can be diff icult to distinguish one tr ee from another because a guidebook cannot show all the possible variations in leaves, bark, or structure that occur over time. The result is that ecological data are un usually complex, presenting daunting problems of interpretation and analysis that pose particular problems for secondary use (cf., Bowker 2000; Bowser 1986; NRC 1995, 1997). The culture of ecology also hampers the sharing and reuse of data. A relatively young science, ecology is currently characterized by modest single investigator studies conducted at limited spatial and temporal scales (NRC 1995). Ecologists do not have an established infrastructure for sharing data, although efforts are underway to change this (Michener et al. 1997; Jones et al. 2001). In general, sharing takes place between close associates and relies heavily on social interaction (Committee on the Future of Long- term Ecological Data 1995). The reasons for this are complex and include few incentives for ecologists to share and a culture that values creative and independent research above secondary use of data p. 637

The special importance of field-based insights is reflected in the similarresponses I received when I asked ecologists if they felt it was necessary tohave collected their own data to understand data collected by others. Thisquestion encouraged ecologists to consider what distinguishes them fromscientists in other fields, and it provided a view into the aspects of theirknowledge that they drew from to reuse data. Ecologists often took theirspecialized knowledge for granted. p. 638","Ecologists discussed the importance of knowing that the purpose for which data were gatheres guides appropriate reuse of them p. 643

Dealing with Uncertainty Data comprehension is closely related to many assessments ecologists make about the quality of data they consider for reuse. The ability to visualize data collection and to understand where errors can occur is a key aspect of ecologists’ abilities to judge data quality p. 644

Focusing on the Object of Study The variability of specific parameters in nature affects how “easy” data are to collect and ecologists weighed this factor when they made data reuse decisions. Fricker (2002, 382) described this as trust based on empirical knowledge “of whether the topic is one about which people are generally trustworthy.” In this case, the object that is being observed or measured is the focus of attention. For example, Michael chose to exclude a certain phylum from the zooplankton data he acquired because he knew that they are hard to identify. p. 644

Focusing on the Data Collector When data are difficult to collect or tolerance for data uncertainty is low, ecologists call on other, more personal, insights from the field to assess the trustwor thiness of data sources. In these cases, the first focus of their scrutiny is on who originally collected the data. Since judgments about an unknown data collector’s skill are often difficult to assess based on informa- tion that accompanies data, it is not surprising that firsthand knowledge of the skills or values of other scientists, whether positive or negative, enters into reuse decisions. For example, Stephen spoke about “commitment to the organisms” when he explained to me why he used species lists generated by scientific programs that he was familiar with and that had been around for a long time p. 646",,,yes

We aimed to assess the current status of making research data available in highly-cited journals across the scientific literature. Methods and Results: We reviewed the first 10 original research papers of 2009 published in the 50 original research journals with the highest impact factor. For each journal we documented the policies related to public availability and sharing of data. Of the 50 journals, 44 (88%) had a statement in their instructions to authors related to public availability and sharing of data. However, there was wide variation in journal requirements, ranging from requiring the sharing of all primary data related to the research to just including a statement in the published manuscript that data can be available on request. Of the 500 assessed papers, 149 (30%) were not subject to any data availability policy. Of the remaining 351 papers that were covered by some data availability policy, 208 papers (59%) did not fully adhere to the data availability instructions of the journals they were published in, most commonly (73%) by not publicly depositing microarray data. The other 143 papers that adhered to the data availability instructions did so by publicly depositing only the specific data type as required, making a statement of willingness to share, or actually sharing all the primary data. Overall, only 47 papers (9%) deposited full primary raw data online. None of the 149 papers not subject to data availability policies made their full primary data publicly available.

However, there was wide variation in journal requirements, ranging from requiring the sharing of all primary data related to the research to just including a statement in the published manuscript that data can be available on request. Some specific types of data had very high frequency of requirement for public deposition. This included public deposition of primary microarray, nucleic acid and protein sequencing data, and macromolecular structures which was required in 36/50 (72%), 40/50 (80%), 39/50 (78%), and 29/50 (58%) journals (Figure 1). Materials and protocols used in published experiments were required to be made available upon request to qualified researchers by 33/50 (66%) and 23/50 (46%) journals, respectively. When instructing authors on data or material sharing, journals used different phrases to indicate how strict these requirements were. Less than half (22/50, 44%) of the journals explicitly indicated that making materials and/or protocols of the published findings (regardless of method and technology employed) available to other qualified investigators was a condition of publication. In their instructions to authors regarding data sharing, these journals used language such as ‘‘with minimal restriction . . . in a timely manner’’ (e.g. Cell family of journals), ‘‘non-compliance … may result in denial of future rights to publish’’ (e.g. Plant Cell), or ‘‘…a condition of publication . . . is . . to make materials, data and associated protocols promptly available . . . without preconditions’’ (e.g. Nature family of journals). An additional 44% (22/50) of the journals had either a non-binding statement encouraging authors to make their data available (e.g. using language like ‘‘it is the responsibility of the authors’’ or ‘‘authors are encouraged to . . .’’), or required a datasharing statement by the authors indicating willingness to share (Annals of Internal Medicine and British Medical Journal). The remainder 6 journals (12%) had no specific instructions to authors related to data availability. p. 2

Many sites are struggling with data management systems unchanged since the projects started many decades ago. These sites do not have the critical mass of programmers and data managers to support the required improvements in data architecture, error reconciliation, and provision of meta-data (information describing the data) for unambiguous interpretation of variables that would be required for efficient data sharing [23]. Because of the piece-meal way that many DSS sites are funded, hosting a variety of different studies that take advantage of their core data collection, many have acquired legacy datasets that are not fully documented and not well integrated in their databases. An enormous programming effort will be needed in many cases to write data dictionaries and edit the data to comply with currently accepted norms. p. 171","Data as a public good: Clearly a balance between “ownership” and “exploitation” of data needs to be maintained. One way to optimise the use of these data sources is to define a maximum time limit (18–24 months) for “private” ownership of data. After this ownership period, datasets should be available for further analysis by any bona fide research groups, as with DHS data. The experience with the Human Genome Project, where the recognition of the public good aspect of the sequencing of the human genome led investigators to agree to put their sequences in the public domain after 48 hours, shows that concerns over private ownership can be overcome for the public good. A relatively longer time limit of 18–24 months for providing access to DSS data is a compromise between creating positive incentives for investigators who spend time collecting highquality data and contributing to the global public good from widespread access.","Wider access to DHS and multiple indicator cluster surveys data has produced important observations on disease burden and public health interventions [11,12]. It is equally likely that provision of access to DSS data would lead to more innovative analyses and increase their relevance for national and regional health development efforts. For example, the DSS data would provide direct evidence on the relationship between contextual factors and the levels, patterns, and causes of death for several populations in Africa in particular, where epidemiological information is scarce. Although the DSS data do not come from a random sample of the reference population, detailed analyses of data from well-defined populations could inform our understanding of relationships between key aspects of population health. By illuminating these relationships, DSS data combined with other, more representative sources of data have the potential to contribute to major global health development initiatives, such as monitoring progress in achieving the health-related millennium development goals and assessing equity in health [13]. However, the millennium development indicators across the DSS sites need to be systematically analysed and disseminated periodically. This would help to realise the potential of DSS data for understanding the generalisability of results from DSS to other parts of the developing world. Fertility and mortality data from 15 DSS sites and model life tables based on these data have been published [1]. Causespecific mortality rates from 1999–2002 from 12 DSS sites [14], and site-specific trends in mortality in specified periods of time have been reported [15,16]. However, there is often a four to five year time lag for summary mortality statistics to be available in the public domain. Furthermore, DSS data are not part of the routine health information system in most countries, and there are no defined time points for updating DSS data available in the public domain. In order to optimise their use, DSS data need to be considered as a “global public health good”. Facilitating wider access after a limited ownership period would encourage investigators to take all possible measures to ensure high-quality data and to disseminate findings in a timely manner because other “external” investigators would eventually analyse the data. The continuous appraisal of data and the dialogue between producers of data and “external” investigators would increase the scope of analyses, interpretation, and use of DSS data that in itself is a key factor in refining data collection tools and methods and leads to a virtuous cycle of improved data quality in the future.",,yes

collected, analyzed, and presented in scholarly reports. We are now 
witnessing a dramatic shift in our relationship to data: where 
researchers once managed discrete, controllable building blocks of 
knowledge, they must now contend with a tsunami of information that 
paradoxically feeds the growing scientific output while simultaneously 
crushing researchers with its weight [1].
 Numerous national and international initiatives, projects, and working 
groups have been established to address the data dilemma from multiple 
angles [2]–[6], including recent Requests for Information from the US Office of Science and Technology Policy [7] and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [8], and a US White House announcement of spending US$200 million on “Big Data” [9].
 The need for information and data management literacy extends beyond a 
national mandate for sharing and public access—the scientific community 
must embrace a culture where every scientist needs to understand how to 
manage, navigate, and curate huge amounts of data. Libraries have 
traditionally been the place to acquire information; now they have 
become the place to learn how to manage it. The eagle-i Consortium (see Box 1),

Because researchers know their data best, one solution is for them to tag their own data using universally agreed upon standards [18]. One effort to address this issue was a 2011 workshop called ‘‘Beyond the PDF’’ [19], aimed at identifying what requirements scholars would need to mark up their published works. This would reduce the burden of information management and interpretation by the army of biocurators currently required to deal with the output of scholarly communication p. 2

To provide scholars with the incentive to share information and data, therefore, we must focus on purpose: biocuration skills need to be developed not as a quick Band-Aid to retrospectively address national mandates, but rather, because it will generate new insight and advance scientific discovery. Moreover, just acquiring the skill to navigate the complex landscape of different data will become a motivating force in itself. p. 3

Learn from incentives that have worked in mass collaborations and open-source software, such as reputation building, enjoyment, cooperatively solving interesting problems that are too hard to do alone, and jointly developing tools that benefit all developers [6,7,19]. Organizational incentives can include lowering costs, tapping external innovation, implementing novel business models such as selling complementary services, and jointly competing for public admiration or grant funding. Altruism can motivate collaboration, but frequently it is not the main reason [9]. With this in mind, align individual incentives with collective benefit [1]. Look to past and present precompetitive collaborations for ways to address intellectual property and competitive concerns [3]. Share attribution with contributors so they can advance their goals and demonstrate their capabilities.

Rule 2: Make Your Controlled Collaborations Win-Win-Win Perhaps completely open science seems unsuitable to you, if for example you are engaged in market-driven R&D that must recoup investments. There are ways to benefit from open science and collaborative methods while retaining appropriate controls and the opportunity to provide public benefit. You, your partners, and the public can all benefit—a win-win-win situation. You might use computational platforms to supercharge information sharing with selected partners, including public-benefit initiatives that match your mission [9].

Empirical evaluations of data sharing may be regarded as an indispensable first step in the identification of critical aspects and the development of strategies aimed at increasing availability of research data for the scientific community as a whole. Research concerning human genetic variation represents a potential forerunner in the establishment of widespread sharing of primary datasets. However, no specific analysis has been conducted to date in order to ascertain whether the sharing of primary datasets is common-practice in this research field. To this aim, we analyzed a total of 543 mitochondrial and Y chromosomal datasets reported in 508 papers indexed in the Pubmed database from 2008 to 2011. A substantial portion of datasets (21.9%) was found to have been withheld, while neither strong editorial policies nor high impact factor proved to be effective in increasing the sharing rate beyond the current figure of 80.5%. Disaggregating datasets for research fields, we could observe a substantially lower sharing in medical than evolutionary and forensic genetics, more evident for whole mtDNA sequences (15.0% vs 99.6%). The low rate of positive responses to e-mail requests sent to corresponding authors of withheld datasets (28.6%) suggests that sharing should be regarded as a prerequisite for final paper acceptance, while making authors deposit their results in open online databases which provide data quality control seems to provide the best-practice standard. Finally, we estimated that 29.8% to 32.9% of total resources are used to generate withheld datasets, implying that an important portion of research funding does not produce shared knowledge. By making the scientific community and the public aware of this important aspect, we may help popularize a more effective culture of data sharing.",PLOS,Genetics,Sharing Data on Human Genetic Variation,meta analysis on PLOS paper a," On the other hand, concerns havebeen raised regarding the actual spread of data sharing habitsamong researchers.

We show in figure 3 that a substantial proportion of datasets (23.2%) is not immediately shared through the published material or information contained therein (body text, supplementary material or online databases), while an important fraction (16.6%) continues to be withheld even after serial e-mail requests to all authors of withheld datasets. No significant difference was observed between mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal polymor- phisms (Table 1), but the relatively frequent use of GenBank for mtDNA data (69 out of 185 shared datasets, corresponding to 37.3%) makes them more easily downloadable (Table 2). Most withholding is due to the fact that results are presented only as data-derived statistics (75 out of 119 datasets, 63.0%), whereas less frequently, individual data are presented but they are not available in complete form (10 out of 119, 8.4%) or only a data subset is actually shared (34 out of 119, 28.6%) (see Table S3 for more details) p. 3

There is a substantial variation in sharing rate of primary datasets across distinct research fields We observed significantly lower sharing rates in Medical Genetics than in Human Evolutionary Genetics and Forensics (figure 3B). The value for Medical Genetics actually conceals a marked difference between maternally and paternally inherited polymorphisms (53.6% and 90.3%, respectively; see Table 1) p. 4

Adoption of explicit editorial policies or impact factor rank has a limited effect on data sharing rates A slightly higher sharing rate was observed for datasets published in journals with strong editorial policies and high impact factor rank (figure 3C and 3D, respectively), a result consistent with the positive association between the policy strength and data sharing that had been previously observed in a study of gene expression microarray data [9]. p. 4

The substantially lower sharing rate observed for Medical rather than for Evolutionary and Forensic Genetics suggests that the type and/or impact of factors limiting data sharing may vary even among closely related fields of research. This finding points to the need to set up tailored approaches for each research field to more effectively increase overall data sharing. p. 5

 The author of this paper suggests that perceiving the cancer research field as being highly competitive and having connections with industry may combine with privacy issues and make researchers less willing to share their data. The first two conditions are probably more present in medical than in forensic or evolutionary genetic research p. 5

However, even in our case, a largeportion of requested datasets (90 out of 126; 71.4%) remainswithheld after serial e-mails. p. 5

","It is also important to note that scientific journals may benefit from adopting stringent sharing data rules since papers whose datasets are available without restrictions are more likely to be cited than withheld ones (see above and ref. 13). Naturally, this may help increase their impact factor, and IJLM and FSIG are indeed the Journals with the highest impact factor in their category ‘‘Medicine, Legal’’ of the Science Citation Index (release 2010) p. 3","ome recent papers have discussed the pros associated with data sharing, pointing to the benefits of more rapid and efficient progress in research, better exploitation of data, optimized use of resources, opportunities for data quality control and promotion of scientific creativity p. 1",,yes

Requesting data from other researchers can be a tortuous and sometimes fruitless process. In a 2006 survey, 50.8% of US researchers reported that data withholding had exerted a negative effect on the progress of their research [7].

Factors Associated with Openly Archiving Raw Research Data,PLoS one,"Open access, Social research, Microarrays, Confidential intervals, Factor analysis, Gene expression, Research grants, Insitutional funding of science",Journal paper,"Many initiatives encourage investigators to share their raw datasets in hopes of increasing research efficiency and quality. Despite these investments of time and money, we do not have a firm grasp of who openly shares raw research data, who doesn't, and which initiatives are correlated with high rates of data sharing. In this analysis I use bibliometric methods to identify patterns in the frequency with which investigators openly archive their raw gene expression microarray datasets after study publication. Automated methods identified 11,603 articles published between 2000 and 2009 that describe the creation of gene expression microarray data. Associated datasets in best-practice repositories were found for 25% of these articles, increasing from less than 5% in 2001 to 30%–35% in 2007–2009. Accounting for sensitivity of the automated methods, approximately 45% of recent gene expression studies made their data publicly available. First-order factor analysis on 124 diverse bibliometric attributes of the data creation articles revealed 15 factors describing authorship, funding, institution, publication, and domain environments. In multivariate regression, authors were most likely to share data if they had prior experience sharing or reusing data, if their study was published in an open access journal or a journal with a relatively strong data sharing policy, or if the study was funded by a large number of NIH grants. Authors of studies on cancer and human subjects were least likely to make their datasets available. These results suggest research data sharing levels are still low and increasing only slowly, and data is least available in areas where it could make the biggest impact. Let's learn from those with high rates of sharing to embrace the full potential of our research output.",PLOS,,"
The set of studies that created gene expression microarray datasets was identified by querying the title, abstract, and full-text of PubMed, PubMed Central, Highwire Press, Scirus, and Google Scholar with portal-specific variants of a previously-derived full-text query. Previous evaluation suggested the query could identify articles that created microarray data with a precision of 90% and a recall of 56%, compared to manual curation. To determine whether these studies had an associated dataset archived in a public centralized repository, I queried the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and EBI’s ArrayExpress databases with article PubMed identifiers. I collected 124 attributes of each study from a wide variety of bibliometric and web-based sources, including MEDLINE, NIH award history, SCImago Institutions Rankings, ISI Journal Citation Reports, journal Instruction to Author policies, Authori-ity authorship clusters (Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009), and a gender-guessing web service.",webometrics,,"In univariate analyses, several factors were correlated with frequency of data sharing.

ntegrate data sharing education into curricula and practice. Data sharing must be articulated as a foundational principle of research conduct. Standardized and comprehensive education is likely to be an important factor in decreasing data withholding [11]; data sharing should be included in the curricula of introductory research courses and throughout mentored research. p. 2

We summarize them here, from the perspective of an AHC. The predominant benefit of data sharing is accelerated scientific progress. Advances are clearly valuable to an AHC when translated into improved patient outcomes, reduced research costs, and decreased time in moving discoveries from the bench to the bedside. Of more immediate benefit to AHCs and their researchers, sharing data increases the visibility and relevance of research output. Sharing data generates opportunities for additional publications through collaboration, and may increase the citation rate of primary publications [7]. Since publication history and citation impact are often considered in future funding decisions, these benefits are likely to accelerate research programs, and thus enhance the reputation of the academic institutions. Data sharing can also benefit an AHC in its roles of educator and employer. Health care professionals trained in clinical informatics [8] benefit from exposure to real-world data. By embracing data sharing goals, an AHC becomes more appealing to cutting-edge researchers [9], and thereby more able to recruit the talent required for future successes. Finally, the widespread adoption of a data sharing culture needs leaders [10], and thus provides an opportunity for AHCs to demonstrate excellence. ",,yes

Savage & Vickers 2009,2009,Empirical Study of Data Sharing by Authors Publishing in PLoS Journals,PLoS one,"Data acquisition, Open access, Genomic medicine, Public policy, Medicine and health sciences, Genomics, Genomic libraries, Researchers",Journal paper,"Background Many journals now require authors share their data with other investigators, either by depositing the data in a public repository or making it freely available upon request. These policies are explicit, but remain largely untested. We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies. Methods and Findings We requested data from ten investigators who had published in either PLoS Medicine or PLoS Clinical Trials. All responses were carefully documented. In the event that we were refused data, we reminded authors of the journal's data sharing guidelines. If we did not receive a response to our initial request, a second request was made. Following the ten requests for raw data, three investigators did not respond, four authors responded and refused to share their data, two email addresses were no longer valid, and one author requested further details. A reminder of PLoS's explicit requirement that authors share data did not change the reply from the four authors who initially refused. Only one author sent an original data set. Conclusions We received only one of ten raw data sets requested. This suggests that journal policies requiring data sharing do not lead to authors making their data sets available to independent investigators.",PLOS,Epidemiology and Biostatistics,We sought to determine how well authors comply with such policies by requesting data from authors who had published in one of two journals with clear data sharing policies.,,"Of the remaining eight investigators with functioning email addresses, four authors replied that sharing their data was not possible, three authors did not respond, and another asked for further details regarding our request. Of the four authors refusing to share their data in response to our initial request, two authors did not give a reason, one stated he was currently too busy, and the fourth said that he no longer had jurisdiction over the data as he had changed institutions. We sent a follow up email to these four investigators and reminded them of PLoS’s data sharing policies. From the two authors who initially refused without providing a reason, one author said that we could submit a formal and lengthy proposal to the appropriate trialists’ group; the other apologized that he had not been aware of the journal’s data sharing policy and, as he was forbidden to pass the data on to third parties, he would not have published in PLoS had he been aware of this requirement. To the investigator who said he was currently too busy, we responded that we could wait to receive the data; his response was that it was simply too much work. Our request to the investigator who had changed institutions was forwarded to the appropriate researchers still working at the institution. They claimed it would take too long to organize and annotate the data set and would be too much work.Three authors simply did not respond to our initial request. After a follow up email to these authors, one author replied that he was in favor of sharing data in general, but wished to conduct more analyses before sharing. We did not receive a reply from the other two authors. One author replied to our initial request by asking for more information about our proposed analysis.

In our experience, storage of binary data in many commercial microscopy formats is based on common formats (TIFF, HDF5, and OLE2, etc.) or other formats that most software tools can read (although there are some notable, extreme exceptions). The much more challenging problem is the metadata. Because standards are not yet agreed upon, microscope and imaging companies define their own metadata formats in their PFFs, and these are often incompatible with those from competing companies. p. 779","Sharing requires centralized repositories, and submission to and utility of these resources require common data formats.

This will build the foundation for an open image data repository. p. 777

One key attribute of the JCB DataViewer that distinguishes it from past and current data repositories is that the original binary data and metadata, additional information captured by acquisition software about an image, such as the instruments used, acquisition settings, image size, and resolution, are preserved and accessible by the community. As of this writing, the JCB DataViewer contains 6,446 multidimensional (5D; including space, channel, and time) images in support of 186 published articles. The JCB DataViewer is a customized application based on the open source and open development Open Microscopy Environment (OME) Remote Objects (OMERO) and Bio-Formats projects, released by the OME Consortium (http://openmicroscopy.org). p. 777

Authors will also retain access to their original data, thereby making the JCB DataViewer an archive where authors can store their own published data. These updates represent one more step toward the development of a fully functional data repository. The data in the JCB DataViewer are freely available to the public immediately upon publication, without a subscription to the JCB. In the future, as image repositories mature, we plan to merge the data held in the JCB DataViewer with whatever resources emerge as the definitive public repository of image data in the life sciences. p. 778

For many years, the imaging community has expressed a desire to move away from the current ad hoc approach toward more defined standards for metadata representation (Goldberg et al., 2005). However, creating a reasonable standard takes years of community discussion and effort. For the standard to be successful, it must be widely used and functional enough to be worth the effort of conformance, and it takes time for the “snowball effect” to occur. Given the diversity and rapid evolution of imaging applications in biology, we don’t believe that standards can be mandated by any one entity. Instead, we argue that standards for biological imaging must be supported and developed, and once they are valuable for scientific discovery and data dissemination and further analysis. As with other forms of data, there is no requirement to publish all images associated with a paper, just the ones that form the definitive representation of the reported discovery. p. 780-781","Data sharing is important in the biological sciences to prevent duplication of effort, to promote scientific integrity, and to facilitate and disseminate scientific discovery. p. 777",,yes
Tenopir et al. 2011,2011,Data Sharing by Scientists: Practices and Perceptions,PLoS one,"Data acquisition, Scientists, Engineering and technology, Medicine and health scientists, Data management, Researchers, Data processing, Ecology and environmental sciences",Journal paper,"Background: Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance: Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.",PLOS,,A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharingpractices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing,Survey,"Journal policies do not work: Although drawn from a small sample of researchers, these resultsstrongly suggest that journal policies which require data sharing donot necessarily lead authors to make their datasets readily availableto other researchers. The amount of data sharing or data hoardingalso appears to vary according to the researcher’s subjectdiscipline. p. 2

Researchers who choose to withhold datasets often have specific reasons for doing so. Savage and Vickers noted reasons that include concerns about patient privacy (for medical fields), concerns about future publishing opportunities, and the desire to retain exclusive rights to data that had taken many years to produce [14]. In Campbell’s study of data sharing in genetics, the top reasons cited for withholding data were the amount of effort involved in accessing and sharing datasets and the protection of a colleague’s or their own ability to publish [15]. The decision to share or withhold data is often dependent upon the point of time in the publishing process at which the request is made. Campbell (2003) reported that nearly all (98.7%) of the technology transfer officers surveyed agreed that academic scientists should freely share data with other scientists after publication, while only 30.5% agreed that scientists should share data and materials before publication. The vast majority also believed that scientists should be more careful when sharing data with industry than with other academics [15]. The PARSE Insight survey indicated that researchers who are reluctant to share data with others reported major concerns with legal issues, misuse of data, and incompatible data types [8]. In a survey of geneticists and other life scientists, Campbell et al., found that withholding data may be more common in genetics and related fields. Reasons may include the increased scientific competitiveness of the field, as well as the opportunities for commercial applications p. 2

The authors came to the conclusion that researchers often fail to develop clear, well-annotated datasets to accompany their research (i.e., metadata), and may lose access and understanding of the original dataset over time. Vickers, et al. believe that a policy that would require authors to submit datasets to journals or public repositories at the time of publication would help to prevent this occurrence p. 2

Data use by subject discipline. A majority of all respondents report they share their data with others, but respondents from the medical fields and social sciences are less likely to make their data electronically available to others (see Table 15). p. 11

Data management support and policies by subject discipline. There is a significant difference based on subject discipline for how respondents’ organizations are involved with data. In terms of having a formal established process for managing data during the life of the project, respondents from atmospheric science (54%) and environmental sciences & ecology (48%) report the most involvement, whereas social sciences (38%) report the least p. 12

Data sharing by subject discipline. Approximately 60% to 90% of respondents in all disciplines agree with the statement that ‘‘they would use other researchers’ datasets if their datasets were easily accessible’’ (see Table 19). Again, a majority of respondents in almost all disciplines, (72% to 92%) ‘‘would be willing to place at least some of their data into a central data repository with no restrictions’’(except medicine respondents with just 47%). Fewer ‘‘would be willing to place all of their data into a central data repository with no restrictions’’. Only 41% to 52% respondents in most disciplines agree with this statement, with medicine (17%) and social sciences (32%) even less likely to agree. These disciplines are likely to have data that may be sensitive to human subject or ethical guidelines. If respondents could place conditions on access, they are more likely to make their data available. Including respondents from medicine, all values increased (between 58% and 71%). Clearly, systems for data deposit need to accommodate conditions and restrictions p. 14

Data management support and policies by age. There are some differences in responses based on age of respondent. Younger people are less likely to make their data available to others (either through their organization’s website, PI’s website, national site, or other sites.). People over 50 showed more interest in sharing data p. 14

Data sharing by activity. Research-intensive respondents report they are more likely to make their data available to others on organization’s websites and global network than teaching- intensive respondents (see Table 28). Both research-intensive respondents (74%) and teaching-intensive respondents (79%) showed a willingness to place at least some of their data into a central data repository with no restrictions and a willingness to share data across a broad group of researchers who use data in different ways, 77% and 83% respectively. This could be attributed to data management requirements by the funding organizations. p. 15

Data sharing by geographic location. Researchers in other parts of the world are most willing to place all of their data into a central data repository with no restrictions (53%); more likely to make their data available if they could place conditions on access (73%); and the most satisfied with their ability to integrate data from disparate sources to address research questions (58%). Researchers in Europe (36%) showed the least support for being willing to place all of their data in a central repository with no restrictions, whereas researchers in North American are least able to integrate data from disparate sources (42%) (see Table 35) p. 17","Infrastructure: Supporting Cyberinfrastructure The development of cyberinfrastructure will play a major role in the future sharing of data. Participants in the PARSE survey named lack of sustainable hardware, software, and support of computer environment as the most important threats to digital preservation. The majority of researchers, data managers, and publishers who participated in the survey believed that an international infrastruc- ture for data preservation should be built [8]. Data needs to be stored and organized in a way that will allow researchers to access, share, and analyze the material. p. 3 

Effective data management and use relies on effective tools. A series of questions about satisfaction with tools for all aspects of the data lifecycle reveal some variation in satisfaction (see Table 6). Only about a quarter (26%) of the respondents is satisfied with the tools for preparing metadata, while over 32% are dissatisfied. The large number of respondents who replied that they neither agree nor disagree (42%) could be interpreted in two ways: either they truly are indifferent or they are unsure about what metadata means. There is some reason to believe that the latter is true as nearly half (46%) of the respondents answered ‘‘none’’ to the question ‘‘What metadata do you currently use to describe your data?’’ Forty two percent reported that they are satisfied with the tools for preparing their documentation; however, 31% indicated that they neither agree nor disagree. p. 7

","Data sharing has many advantages, including: 1. re-analysis of data helps verify results data, which is a key part of the scientific process; 2. different interpretations or approaches to existing data contribute to scientific progress –especially in an interdisci- plinary setting; 3. well-managed, long-term preservation helps retain data integrity; 4. when data is available, (re-)collection of data is minimized; thus, use of resources is optimized; 5. data availability provides safeguards against misconduct related to data fabrication and falsification; 6. replication studies serve as training tools for new generations of researchers p. 1

Respondents were asked their agreement on a five-point scaleto a series of statements (see Table 8). Nearly two thirds (67%) ofthe respondents agreed that lack of access to data generated byother researchers or institutions is a major impediment toprogress in science. Half (50%) of the respondents reported thatlack of access to data generated by other researcher or institutionhas restricted their ability to answer scientific questions. Threequarters (75%) of the respondents replied that data may bemisinterpreted due to complexity of the data across their researchfield and 71% of the respondents agree that data may bemisinterpreted due to poor quality of data across their researchfield",,yes

Here the participant also identified the need to avoid repeating the work of the past by working together and sharing data, rather than by pursuing common lines of research independently. p. 6

Another participant collected data primarily to share them with others. Similar to the above participant, he recognized how the availability of data might positively affect the progress of science; For the above participant, the motivation for sharing was to enable other researchers to ask new questions, especially questions that would otherwise have been impossible to address.p. 6

Yet another participant noted that she shared data because she recognized that others may find the data interesting or useful. She explained that she posted some of her data online because, ‘‘I think some of our data showing the changes, like the seasonal changes and patterns in the lake, would be of interest to other people’’ (2006 Interview 10 – Staff – Science). Although she did not specify whom she thinks would be interested in her data, her realization that someone would want her data was motivation enough to try to make them available. p. 6

One motivation was to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, as was noted by the following participant. p. 6

Some perceived direct advantages for sharing data. This participant, who develops open source robotic platforms, suggested that his research group would benefit from the adoption of their data due to network effects: If such a request arrives, then we immediately grant it because we would like to actually share all of our information and all of our systems to the wider academic community. And so such a request arrived before, and [we] provided the data immediately, and we not only share the data but also the platforms we developed. p. 6

Conditions: Although the participants interviewed were willing, in principle, to share their data, they identified a number of conditions to be met before they would share. The most commonly cited conditions for sharing data were (1) first rights to publish results, (2) proper attribution to the data source, (3) familiarity between sharer and recipient, (4) funding agency expectations, and (5) the amount of effort required to share. p. 7

15 of 22 participants said that they would share data only in situations where the originating team retained the first rights to publish results from the data. This condition was by far the most frequently mentioned. p. 7

Five of the 22 participants in Round 1 were concerned about receiving proper attribution for the work they had done to collect and to share their data. p.7

standard for systematically citing data is necessary to encourage data sharing, especially for repositories that mediate the interaction between the person using the data and the person or team sharing the data; p.7

Four participants from Round 2 would share data only with someone they knew. These concerns intersected with those of first rights to publish. One participant who mentioned both of these conditions said, ‘‘If someone else called me that I didn’t know, I would definitely think about… giving over data, because it makes it less publishable in even what we do’’ (2009 Interview 7 – Faculty – Science). Another participant was willing to share data with almost anyone, but when she knows someone personally, she would invest extra effort to prepare and to share the data: p. 7

Four of 21 participants in Round 2 expressed concern about the amount of effort required to help someone else understand the data he or she might share. As this participant notes, he is more likely to share his data when he feels that the person receiving the data will not need much help or explanation to use them p. 7

We identified subtle but important differences between the use of repositories and registries to share and to obtain data. They are coded as separate categories for sharing and for sources of data. Repositories contain data, whether from observatories or contributed by individual investigators. Registries record the existence of a dataset and include a brief description and contact information, but do not ingest the data, per se. Below we discuss the three methods most commonly mentioned for sharing data, whose order varies between interview rounds: (1) fulfill personal requests, (2) post data to a website, and (3) submit data to a repository. Also reported in this section is a complementary case study of datasets posted to the CENS website. p. 8

While participants often mentioned that public repositories are a good method of sharing, only four participants in Round 1 could name a repository that they would use, and only two had deposited their data into a public, discipline-specific repository. The data being deposited, in both cases, were genetic in nature. p. 8

One participant, when asked about being contacted to share data, explained that although he was generally willing to comply with requests, he tried to get a sense of who was asking, to gain more control over the release of his data; p. 9

The lack of demand and the lack of discoverability appear to be a chicken-and-egg problem, which we divide into three sets of implications: practices for releasing and sharing data, practices for using external sources of data, and requirements for scholarly infrastructure to support the long tail of science and technology research. p. 14

Self-enrollment by 17% (n = 1,136) of n = 6,500 active members representing 32 countries and 50 US states. Data were current with 83.1% of most recent A1c values reported obtained within the past 90 days. Sharing was high with 81.4% of users permitting data donation to the community display. 34.1% of users also displayed their A1cs on their SN profile page. Users selecting the most permissive sharing options had a lower average A1c (6.8%) than users not sharing with the community (7.1%, p = .038). 95% of users permitted re-contact. Unadjusted aggregate A1c reported by US users closely resembled aggregate 2007–2008 NHANES estimates (respectively, 6.9% and 6.9%, p = 0.85). Conclusions Success within an early adopter community demonstrates that online SNs may comprise efficient platforms for bidirectional communication with and data acquisition from disease populations.

However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically. Methods and Findings We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance. Conclusions Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions.

Why, then, have we seen few widespread changes in how scholars disseminate research in most disciplines? Drawing on qualitative interview data from the Mellon-funded Future of Scholarly Communication Project (2005–2011), we describe how scholars share their work-in-progress and the disciplinary values driving these practices. We then discuss credit, time, and personality as significant barriers to change across disciplines, and we explore these obstacles through an examination of two new paradigms for sharing: open peer review and data sharing. By situating larger discussions about the future of scholarly communication in the everyday lives of scholars, we argue that integration with disciplinary cultures will be key to the success of new media initiatives.",ProQuest,Scholarly Communication,not particularly data,"This article is based upon the qualitative interview, observational, workshop, and textual
data collected during the seven-year Future of Scholarly Communication Project
(2005–2011), funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.","Despite these opportunities and mandates, however, data sharing is idiosyncratic and may not occur at all in many fields (Borgman, 2012; Harley et al., 2010; Nelson, 2009; Noor et al., 2006; Schofield et al., 2009). p. 389

Data sets, exhibitions, tools/instruments, and other ‘subsidiary’ products are awarded far less credit in tenure and promotion decisions than standard publications unless they are themselves ‘discussed’ in a peer-reviewed publication (Harley et al., 2010: 18). Although some have suggested that enabling citation of data would equalize the currency of data outputs with formal publications (cf. Australian National Data Service, 2011), our findings suggest that the solution is not so simple. While making data citable may satisfy ‘attribution’, it would not solve the problem of credit, which requires that data be stringently peer reviewed. It is not clear how or when data will be formally peer reviewed in the same way that journals and books are currently. Who has the time? Indeed, The Journal of Neuroscience (Maunsell, 2010) and the Journal of Experimental Medicine (Borowski, 2011) recently announced their decisions to cease the publication of supplementary data because reviewers cannot realistically spend the time necessary to review that material closely, and critical information on data or methods needed by readers can be lost in a giant, time-consuming ‘data dump’. p. 389

In the sciences, this can take the form of holding onto data to secure proof of principle for one’s next grant application: ‘You don’t dare publish the results until you’ve got the NIH grant that you’re using those results to get’ (Harley et al., 2010: 279).13 Additionally, some scholars are reluctant to share their data for fear that it is ‘messy’ or that their work practices will come under too much scrutiny. p. 389

Data sharing is also greatly impeded by scholars’ lack of personal time to prepare the data and necessary metadata for deposit and reuse (which includes the sometimes Herculean efforts of converting analog data to digital formats, or migrating old digital formats to new ones). For scholars focused on credit, narrowly defined, there is no advantage to spending time (and grant funding) curating data, when that same time can be applied to the next research project and/or publishing books and articles. While data sharing may be facilitated by development of new tools and instruments that ensure standardization (such as in gene sequencing), the idiosyncratic ways in which scholars work, and the extreme heterogeneity of data types in most non-computational fields, do not lend themselves to one-size-fits-all models of data sharing. The escalation of funder requirements (e.g., NSF, NIH) for sharing data management plans points to an important space to track.14 We predict that faculty will not be doing the work, but rather a new professional class and academic track (perhaps akin to museum curators, specialist librarians, or tool-builders) may emerge to take on these new scholarly roles p. 389","Securing prestige, credit, and attribution p. 384
Managing finite time and limited resources: It is ironic perhaps, given the predictions about unlimited possibilities afforded by new Web 2.0 tools, that the importance placed by tenure and promotion committees, grant review committees, and scholars themselves, on archival publication in the top peer-reviewed outlets is growing, not decreasing, in competitive research universities (Van Dalen and Henkens, 2012). p. 385

Individual characteristics and personality In combination with receiving credit and time management, personality can trump the conventions in a field. Defining what is ‘good enough’ to share is often a subjective decision that has its roots in the context of an individual scholar’s specific academic training and research habits. There are economists and astrophysicists who do not share working papers or preprints, and there are molecular biologists (like the one quoted below) who have no qualms about sharing unpublished work openly: p. 386

Edwards et al. 2011,2011,"Science Friction: Data, Metadata, and Collaboration",Social Studies of Science,"collaboration, communication, data, metadata",Journal paper,"When scientists from two or more disciplines work together on related problems, they often face what we call ‘science friction’. As science becomes more data-driven, collaborative, and interdisciplinary, demand increases for interoperability among data, tools, and services. Metadata – usually viewed simply as ‘data about data’, describing objects such as books, journal articles, or datasets – serve key roles in interoperability. Yet we find that metadata may be a source of friction between scientific collaborators, impeding data sharing. We propose an alternative view of metadata, focusing on its role in an ephemeral process of scientific communication, rather than as an enduring outcome or product. We report examples of highly useful, yet ad hoc, incomplete, loosely structured, and mutable, descriptions of data found in our ethnographic studies of several large projects in the environmental sciences. Based on this evidence, we argue that while metadata products can be powerful resources, usually they must be supplemented with metadata processes. Metadata-as-process suggests the very large role of the ad hoc, the incomplete, and the unfinished in everyday scientific work.",ProQuest,Social sciences,"interoperability among data, tools, and services",,"science friction: Data friction leads inevitably to what we call ‘science friction’: the difficulties encountered when two scientific disciplines working on related problems try to interoperate. To take a prominent example, consider the tension between weather forecasting and climatology, separate fields within the disciplinary landscape of meteorology. Weather forecasters have been collecting daily observations since the 1850s. In service of their chief goal – accurate near-term forecasting – their priority is swift communication and constant improvement of observing and forecasting systems. Even week-old data have little value for tomorrow’s forecast, so until recent decades forecasters placed a low priority on storing, cataloguing, and accessing historical weather data. p. 4

This data friction results in enormous expenditures of time, energy, and attention, which can lead to other kinds of science friction as well. Take the so-called ‘Climategate’ controversy over emails and data stolen from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU) in November 2009. p. 5

Metadata-friction: Extensive, highly structured metadata often are seen as a holy grail, a magic chalice both necessary and sufficient to render sharing and reusing data seamless, perhaps even automatic. For example, Gray et al. (2005) state that successful scientific analysis of large datasets depends crucially on developing ‘extensive metadata and metadata standards that will make it easy to discover what data exist, make it easy for people and programs to understand the data, and make it easy to track data lineage’. In the last two decades, considerable effort has been devoted to defining metadata standards applicable to scientific datasets. Among many others, these include: the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model; the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF), a ‘self-describing’ machine-independent data format; and the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions, which build on NetCDF for purposes specific to Earth system science (Hankin et al., 2009; Lavoie, 2004; Lawrence et al., 2009). Several metadata standards have been certified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). All such schemes approach metadata as explicit information, compiled in standardized categories and tightly controlled vocabularies. XML schemes are another widely used approach to metadata formalization. XML p. 7",,,,yes

Second, the revolution in information technology (IT) and information networks has had reverberations outside the law of intellectual property in the evolving norms of the scientific community regarding data- sharing.

patents",,"Intellectual property law has so far played a relatively small role in debates about data-sharing. Data are generally considered ineligible for either copyright or patent protection.21 The Bayh-Dole Act,22 which governs patent rights in the results of federally sponsored research, has nothing to say about the dissemination of unpatentable data. Although sui generis database protection has been enacted in Europe23 and proposed in the United States,24 it has not yet been passed into law in the United States and appears to have had little impact in Europe. p. 1021

The absence of federal IP rights in data under US law is by no means a guarantee that data will be shared freely in the public domain. Quite the contrary, in the absence of statutory protection such as a patent or copyright that survives beyond disclosure, a standard strategy for preserving the commercial value of data and databases has been secrecy or, more accurately, restricted access. p. 1023","The National Research Council took charge of the ensuing debate by forming a Committee on Responsibilities of Authorship in the Biological Sciences to examine the topic of sharing published data and materials. After an open meeting at which diverse viewpoints were expressed (Marshall, 2002a), that Committee issued a report that called upon authors to include in their publications or otherwise make freely available “the data, algorithms, or other information that is central or integral to the publication—that is, whatever is necessary to support the major claims of the paper and would enable one skilled in the art to verify or replicate the claims” (National Research Council, 2003: 5).

",,,,"Qualitative data archiving empowers scholars to store, access, and download electronic qualitative data of all types. These include, for example, interview tapes, text files (transcripts from interviews, focus groups, and oral histories; case notes; meeting minutes; research diaries), scans of newspaper articles, images of official documents, and photographic, audio, and video materials. Registered users of the contemplated repository will be able to find and access potentially useful qualitative data sets through searching metadata elements as well as content.2 User-access controls will regulate who is able to search and retrieve the data sets housed in the repository, with more sensitive materials being restricted. [...] At present, if a qualitative scholar wishes to check the findings of another, they typically have to do research on the same topic. By making data available and increasing the transparency and visibility of research processes, qualitative data archiving can dramatically reduce the costs of assessing empirically based analysis through replication (Swan and Brown 2008, 7). This is likely to be especially significant for multimethod studies (see e.g., Lieberman 2005), where the unavailability of the data underpinning the qualitative portion of the research has complicated evaluation and replication, rendering the qualitative component the presumed weaker dimension of the research. Second, qualitative data archiving will allow for the vertical integration of primary data, secondary analysis, and scholarly output.3 This integration will generate transparency— researchers will be able to show more clearly how they arrived at their inferences and interpretations—with multiple positive effects on practice, pedagogy, and collaboration. In terms of practice, increased visibility will lead to increased rigor. Researchers who anticipate transparency will be motivated to carry out data collection and analysis in a systematic, replicable way. Having access to clear descriptions of how primary research and secondary data analysiswere carried out will also allow scholars to learn from others’ experiences and avoid reproducing mistakes—as well as to discuss, critique, and improve qualitative methods more readily. Data archiving will also provide valuable pedagogical and coordination tools. Scholars teaching qualitative methods courses can ask their students to identify and discuss a range of empirical research techniques employed in studies housed in such repositories, and practice the analytic techniques they are learning on “real” empirical data. Also, the publication of data will vastly increase the visibility of scholars working on particular topics. This greater visibility, in addition to the tools for collaborative research that such repositories can provide, will facilitate team research and the formation of epistemic communities aroundresearchareasandquestions(SwanandBrown2008,26). Finally, archiving qualitative data will allow data to accumulate, andwill facilitatecomparative research.Archiving qualitative data reduces the risks of data loss that personal storage poses,andminimizesthe transaction costs associated with data sharing. Usually, qualitative data are researcher-centric, gathered in connection with a specific inquiry, and used just once (SwanandBrown2008, 7).4 Depositing data in a repositoryand making them available to other analysts will encourage efficiency by preempting the unnecessary repetition of research. Further, a repository will allow scholars to undertake research in the context of amuchlarger universe ofavailable data.Hence, qualitative data archiving will help individual scholars make comparisonsofmanytypes—acrossspace(countries,cities,etc.), across time, across policy areas, across groups, and so on—that could otherwise require additional researchresources or assembling a research team (Corti 2000a, 6.2). Data archiving raises the interesting and seemingly disconcerting possibility that qualitative research could be undertaken without the scholar directly engaging with any of the cases from which the data under analysis were drawn. While this is entirely unexceptional for quantitative scholars (who routinely start their analysis with another scholar’s data set), it is a departure for qualitative scholars forwhomclose engagement with cases is typical, and perhaps obligatory.We do not anticipate that the introduction of qualitative social science data archiving in theUnited States will lead to either an immediate or eventual disconnect from cases for qualitative researchers. Nevertheless, beginning to archive qualitative data will doubtless provoke a spirited, healthy (and perhaps overdue) debate on the potential value of and risks involved in secondary data analysis. p. 23",,yes

Reidpath & Allotey 2001,2001,Data sharing in medical research: an empirical investigatio.,Bioethics,---,Report,"Background: Scientific research entails systematic investigation. Publishing the findings of research in peer reviewed journals implies a high level of confidence by the authors in the veracity of their interpretation. Therefore it stands to reason that researchers should be prepared to share their raw data with other researchers, so that others may enjoy the same level of confidence in the findings. Method: In a prospective study, 29 corresponding authors of original research articles in a medical journal (the British Medical Journal) were contacted to ascertain their preparedness to share the data from their research. The email contact was in one of two forms, a general request and a specific request. The type of request a researcher received was randomly allocated. Findings: Researchers receiving specific requests for data were less likely, and slower, to respond than researchers receiving general requests. Only one researcher released data. Most researchers were reluctant to release their data. Some required further information, clarification, or authorship. Interpretation: The general reluctance of researchers to consider requests for their data is of concern. It raises questions about the level of confidence that should be placed on their interpretations of the data. It also highlights an unfortunate situation where researchers are more concerned with losing an advantage than advancing science.",ProQuest,,,,"A first set of issues concerns data-collection practices. As we noted above, by making research procedures transparent, qualitative data archiving can encourage scholars to be more self-conscious and rigorous in how they undertake data collection. However, this transparency may also have the unintended consequence of encouraging researchers to engage in self-censorship, omitting data collected using a technique they fear will not be considered rigorous, or failing to record relevant observations that they worry may reflect badly upon themselves or a subject.5 A related problem is that if “shareability” becomes an overriding virtue by which data are judged, scholars may be influenced to focus solely on contexts where they can collect data that can be easily deposited. Important information that could have been collected and used with discretion will go unsolicited. The possibility of unintended collateral outcomes such as these highlights the importance of a sustained disciplinary conversation about the merits and limitations of data sharing p. 24

Another series of concerns relates to limits on sharing qualitative data. Much field research involves interaction with human subjects—interviews and focus groups, oral histories, and ethnographic studies. Institutional review boards (IRBs) are likely to require that researchers who wish to store and share via the repository information gained through these interactions solicit subjects’ permission (Mauthner, Parry, and Backett-Milburn 1998, 743; Heaton 2004, 79).6 Inevitably, some subjects will be unable or unwilling to have their identity revealed and/or information they provide made available to other scholars (Corti, Foster, and Thompson 1995, 3) p. 24",,,,yes
Tucker 2009,2009,Motivating Subjects: Data Sharing in Cancer Research,---,"data sharing, biomedical informatics, cancer research, metaphor, reversal theory",Dissertation,"This dissertation explores motivation in decision-making and action in science and technology, through the lens of a case study: scientific data sharing in cancer research. The research begins with the premise that motivation and emotion are key elements of what it means to be human, and consequently, are important variables in how individuals make decisions and take action. At the same time, institutional controls and social messaging send a variety of signals intended to motivate specific actions and behaviors. Understanding the interplay between personal motives and social influences may point to strategies that better align individual and social perceptions and discourse. To explore these dynamics, this research centers on a large-scale cancer research program led by the National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute. The goal of the program is to encourage interoperability and data sharing between diverse and highly autonomous cancer centers across the U.S. Housed in an organization focused on biomedical informatics, the program has a technologically-focused mission; the goal is to facilitate institutional data sharing to connect the cancer research enterprise. This focus contrasts with the more relationship-based point-to-point data sharing currently reported by researchers as the norm. Researchers are motivated to share data with others under specific conditions: when there is a foundation of trust with the person or community being shared with; when the perceived reward of sharing is well-defined and of value to the person sharing; and when there is perceived to be a lower risk or cost than the benefit received. Without these conditions, there are often determined to be insufficient incentives and rewards for sharing. Data sharing is both a personal decision and a social level problem. Data is both subjective and personal; it is often an extension of researcher’s identity, and serves as a measure of his or her value and capability. In the search for standards and interoperable data sets, institutional and technologically-mediated forms of data sharing are perceived to ignore the subjective and local knowledge embodied in the data being shared. To explore these dimensions, this study considers the technology, economics, legal elements, and personal sides of data sharing, and applies two conceptual frameworks to evaluate alternatives for action.",ProQuest,Science and Technology,,30 semi-structured interviews,"anxiety and fear about getting grants, guilt and embarrassment about mesy data, frustration about the legal barriers, feeling insulted and irritated towards people who underestimate the time required to share, regret about negative impact, humiliation of getting scooped, amazement and wonder at new bioinformatics tools p. 190f",,,,yes

Journals were assigned to the high IF category on condition that their value falls within the 1st IF quartile, with ranking based on values released by ISI Reuters in June 2009. We considered the editorial policies weak when there was no reference to data availability or authors were simply invited to share data. In strong policies data sharing was explicitly indicated as mandatory. We observed a noticeable increase in data sharing rates for datasets published in journals with a high impact factor (from 76.67% to 88.35%) and strong sharing policies (from 82.00% to 88.60%).

Assessing conservation achievements in protected areas is of crucial importance with respect to the on-time delivery of international biodiversity conservation targets. However, monitoring data from publicly accessible databases for comparative studies of conservation achievements in the protected areas of the world are very scarce, if not non-existent. At first glance this is surprising because, with regards to protected areas, at least according to well established protected area management guidelines and widely accepted public mandates, a great deal of monitoring work and data gathering is to be conducted. This would imply that data on changes of biodiversity in pro- tected areas could be expected to exist, and the constant progress in information technologies and Web tools engenders hope that some of it might even be available online for the global public. This review article presents the results of an extensive online search and review of existing monitoring data from freely accessible online databases for its use in an assessment of conservation achievements in a larger sample of protected areas. Results show two contrary sides to the status quo of accessible data from the World Wide Web for conservation science: data overkill and data scarcity with poor metadata provision. While ever more research is, in fact, based on open-access online data, such as extrapolations of species ranges used in conservation man- agement and planning, it remains almost impossible to obtain a basic set of information for an assessment of conservation achievements within a larger number of protected areas. This awareness has triggered a detailed discussion about the discrepancies in sharing data at the level of protected areas; mismatching relationships between expected activities in protected areas and the capacity for delivering these requirements are certainly among the main challenges. In addition, the fear of data misuse potentially resulting in harm for nature, careers, and competencies still seems to be a critical barrier strictly controlling the willingness to share data. Various initiatives aimed at tackling technical and cultural obstacles are introduced and discussed to reach the goal of a modern resource management based on adaptive management using digital oppor- tunities of the new millennium for a sustainable global village.",ScienceDirect,Environmental Management,,,,,,,no

Since then, reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy, and the UK government’s commitment to sustainable development, have signalled a policy shift towards integrated rural development. Implementation is partly constrained by an institutional framework that evolved to set, deliver and evaluate sectoral policy. A particular legacy of this framework concerns the way data are gathered. This issue has been explored in a case study on the rural data infrastructure of Scotland. The findings highlight: the currently low level of user awareness of data sources; the lack of central government engagement in and individual awareness of related UK data infrastructure initiatives; and the current focus on top–down data provision being a constraint on community-led development. The commentary explores the interplay between policy and technology drivers and we argue that, whilst data sharing has been assumed to be a technical problem, there is evidence to suggest that it is more a social one concerning power relationships both within and between institutions.

Brakewood & Poldrack 2013,2013,The ethics of secondary data analysis: Considering the application of Belmont principles to the sharing of neuroimaging data,NeuroImage,---,Journal paper,"The sharing of data is essential to increasing the speed of scientific discovery and maximizing the value of public investment in scientific research. However, the sharing of human neuroimaging data poses unique ethical concerns. We outline how data sharing relates to the Belmont principles of respect-for-persons, justice, and beneficence. Whereas regulators of human subjects research often view data sharing solely in terms of poten- tial risks to subjects, we argue that the principles of human subject research require an analysis of both risks and benefits, and that such an analysis suggests that researchers may have a positive duty to share data in order to maximize the contribution that individual participants have made",ScienceDirect,Neuro Science,"In this paper, we will focus on the sharing of data from nonclinical studies, which are those in which subjects are individuals who are not receiving treatment from any personnel associated with the research or from that institution. ",,,"Sensitive data: 

Principle 1: Respect for persons The Belmont report states that respect for persons is a principle that has two “ethical convictions”: people should be able to make autonomous decisions and peoplewith limited autonomy should be protected (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 1978). Others have argued that a broader application of the principle of respect for persons should also include recognizing the inherent dignity of people, recognizing that autonomy is only one aspect of the principle (Beach et al., 2005). Autonomous decision-makingmeans that a subject needs to have the ability to think about his or her choice to participate or not and the ability to actually act on that decision. Subjects must have sufficient information in a format they understand, and they must have the ability to choose. If there is something that limits a person's autonomy (e.g., age or cognitive capacity), then he or she may need special protections. p.673

> In order for a subject to participate in a study, the researcher has an affirmative duty to ensure that the individual has the ability to voluntarily agree to participate (legal or mental capacity and in a situation free of coercion or undue influence), understands what the research entails (in terms of the purpose, procedures, risks, potential benefits, etc.), and actually indicates agreement to participate (consent).
> In a secondary data analysis study, this application is more nuanced. It may not be possible to collect informed consent to participate in specific secondary research studies at the imaging sessions; those studies may not yet be developed or even conceived of at the time of data collection.

Principle 2: Beneficence Beneficence, in the Belmont report, is a positive obligation to both not injure a participant (not limited only to physical injury), but also to maximize benefits andminimize necessary harms (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 1978). In other arenas, some of these duties may be categorized as nonmaleficence, but the Belmont report includes them under the principle of beneficence. In clinical practice, sometimes subjects must be harmed to receive a benefit — for example, when chemotherapy is necessary to combat a cancer. p. 673

Principle 3: Justice Justice, as a Belmont principle, refers to the concept of distributive justice — a balance of benefit and burden (National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 1978). The risks borne by a research population should not result in data, technology, or advances from which they cannot benefit. p. 673

Providing subjects with some information about the potential use of their data and allowing them to opt-in or opt-out of all data sharing are some of the ways to address this issue. Separate from the ethical issues for human subjects, it may not be practical to restrict data by “type” of research, because all of the future topics and potential uses will not be known at the time the subject makes a choice. This tacticwill also create bureaucratic and administrative difficulties in creating a system that will allow this fine level of control by researchers and participants; this type of burden maymake sharing data impractical for investigators who are already feeling burdened by administrative tasks

In secondary data analysis, the main risk to participants that must be minimized is that of a breach of confidentiality. The most important way to minimize this risk is ensuring that data are not identifiable — or at least have a low likelihood of being re-identified. This includes removing all identifying information prior to sharing the data. Table 1 lists the 18 unique identifiers defined in HIPAA; each of these should be removed from the data prior to sharing. This includes defacing images with tools like MRI Defacer or Quickshear (Schimke and Hale, 2012). In some cases (e.g., family studies or studies of geographically limited populations), this would still not be sufficient to protect against re-identification, which would require other administrative remedies (i.e., releasing data under a strict data security plan) or mathematical methods (e.g., transforming the data using generalizations and suppression).

","Here again, secondary data analysis can have a positive impact on this characteristic of research studies. Allowing researchers to pool information from subjects and populations to which they might not have ready access increases not only the generalizability of findings, but also increases the likelihood that individual and social justice mandates are met. If researchers cannot use existing, de-identified data sources to evaluate hypothesis, they will necessarily be limited in their subject selection. Denying use of existing data may actually reduce the ability to spread the benefit of knowledge by decreasing access for a larger population to whom it may be generalized. Further, it may require that more individuals be exposed to the (admittedly minimal) risk of MRI research procedures, thus decreasing the benefit and increasing the societal burden overall. p. 676

Ultimately, the regulatory system in the US relies primarily on ethical behavior fromprincipal investigators and rigorous analysis of ethical principles from institutional review boards. Principal investigators who chose to share data with other researchers have a responsibility to determine that the data will be used in accordance with the principles above. More importantly, these same principles may include a positive duty to actually seek out opportunities to share data in order to maximize the contribution that individual participants have made. p. 676",,yes
Chen et al. 2008,2008,A DSM-based fragmented data sharing framework for grids,Future Generation Computer Systems,"Data grid, Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) On-demand access Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) On-demand access Data consistency, Teamster-G",Journal paper,"Sharing scientific and data capture files of gigabyte and terabyte size in conventional data grid systems is inefficient because conventional approaches copy the entire shared file to a user’s local storage even when only a tiny file fragment is required. Such transfer schemes consume unnecessary data transmission time and local storage space, with the additional problem of maintaining replica synchronization. Traditionally, replica consistency treats shared files as read-only, consequently sacrificing guaranteed replica consistency. This paper presents a DSM-based fragmented data sharing framework called ‘‘Spigot’’ which transfers only the necessary fragments of large files on user demand, thereby reducing data transmission time, wasted network bandwidth and required storage space. Data waiting time is further reduced by overlapping data transmission and data analysis. The DSM concept maintains replica synchronization. Real experiments show reduced turnaround time in data-intensive applications, particularly when fragment size is low and analysis time and network latency are high.",ScienceDirect,,,,,,,,no

Therefore, the need to address and share research data and materials in a systematic way emerged almost simultaneously. This movement has been described as the so-called global research commons. Also in microbiology, where the sharing of microbiological materials is a key issue, microbial commons is attracting attention. Microbiology is currently facing great challenges with the advances of high throughput screening and next-generation whole genome sequencing. Furthermore, the exploration and use of microorganisms in agriculture and food production are increasing so as to safeguard global food and feed production. Further to several meetings on the subject, a special issue of Research in Microbiology is dedicated to Microbial Research Commons with a series of reviews elaborating its major pay-offs and needs in basic and applied microbiology.

Despite the steadily growing scientific demand, data are not easily accessed. Why is this the case? This study explores the reasons for the reluctance to share data on the one hand and the motivations for sharing on the other by summarising results from >60 interviews and >700 survey participants within the biodiversity science community. As result, there is a clear commitment to share biodiversity data, but also a reluctance to actually do so due to a mixture of social and technical impediments, such as loss of control over data and lack of professional reward for sharing. This exploratory study summarises the formal and technical requirements for data sharing and reuse, stated by voluntarily participating scientists worldwide. To ensure sustainable data use, user friendly data infrastructure have to be expanded or newly designed, data manage- ment plans for all scientific investigations have to be promoted, training for the users has to be provided and motivational aspects at all stages of data submission and re-use have to be considered.",ScienceDirect,Ecological Informatics,Review,Survey,"From the US and the EU overall positive responses were slightly higher than the average, while responses from Germany and Canada >20% showed reluctance to do so. Only yes or no was allowed. Most of the participants (78%) claimed to already share data generated in their laboratories (Appendix B27), mostly after publication (76%; Appendix B18). Some are willing to share after the end of a project (25%), immediately (16%) or at retirement (5%: Appendix B18). In general responses were quite similar between scientists of the different countries p. 27

The main concern of the participants regarding sharing their data was “loss of control” (53%) and the amount of time they would have to invest to get the data ready to share (50%). In general, most researchers spend more than a week per year on data curation and data upload (41%, Appendix B10). Researchers from the EU, US and Canada responded quite similar to the questions, while German researchers diverge. In Germany the highest percentage of researchers (37%, Appendix B10) spends less than a day per year on this activity. p. 28

The lack of community-wide standards for managing data sharing was an additional obstacle to the participants (34%, also see 3. 5). Less than half (40%) of the participants are aware of community wide standards in their field of research (Appendix B8). Only in systematics the percentage of participants that feel there are community wide standards (49%) is higher than those who feel there are no such standards (47%) p. 28

One-third of the participants are worried that someone reusing the data will draw wrong conclusions (31%) or claimed that legal and confidentiality issues would prevent data sharing p. 28

More than half of the participants knew about databases to deposit their specific research data (60%), while the others (40%) did not know about any data repositories (Appendix B9). A list of all mentioned databases is in Appendix B9; with GenBank being by far the most often mentioned one. p. 29

Even more obvious is the difference in Germany: whereas 60% of researchers willing to share data state that there is a database in which they can deposit it, it is only 30% of those who are unwilling (Appendix B9). The percentage of researchers generating molecular data that are aware of databases in which they can deposit their data is higher than average (76%) (Appendix B9). 

The majority of participants feel that they are the owner of the data they produce (58%) or that their institution owns it (44%) (Appendix B11). At least 12% are uncertain about the ownership of their data (Appendix B11) with similar answers in Germany, the EU, the US and Canada and among scientists being willing or unwilling to share data. p. 28

The main motivation for researchers to share data is the availability of comparable data sets for comprehensive analyses (72%), while networking with other researchers (71%) was almost equally important (Fig. 3, Appendix B22). Other reasons to share data are transparency of results (62%), that the generation of research data is often financed by public money (48%) and that data sharing increases one's visibility in the community (36%; Fig. 3, Appendix B22). Requirements by journals (59%) and funding agencies (57%) are major motivators (Appendix B23). Possibilities to cite data sets like publications (58%) could motivate researchers to share data (Appendix B23), even though the answers differed between countries. In Germany the main incentive is data set citation (70%), in the USA, and Canada the requirement by journals is most important (70% and 67% respectively, Appendix B23). Being recognized or cited for sharing data with others would more strongly motivate researchers to do so (64%) (Appendix B19). Also a place (52%) and funding (49%) to deposit data would encourage data sharing among researchers more likely. Another important criterion is the ability to control the reuse of data (38%, Appendix B19). Asked how they would like to be recognised for sharing their data the majority of participants (71%) answered “like a publication in the references” (Appendix B20). About one-third (36%) were content with being mentioned in the acknowledgements and 33% would like to appear as co-authors of any publication using their data sets. p. 28

Conditions that have to be met for researchers to deposit their data in a database include the possibility to edit (67%) and delete (48%) data after uploading (Appendix B21). A user friendly data upload is required (64%) and the long term maintenance of the database has to be guaranteed (63%). Important are also that researchers are contacted if someone else wants to use their data (60%) and that a history of data use is displayed (56%). Furthermore, guidelines for the reuse of data is important (62%). The quality of data has to be secured (55%). The list of free text answers includes the suggestion to use a flagging system for data quality and an annotation system (Appendix B21 p. 28

Additional features of an optimised data portal should be the possibility to annotate data and to combine and present different data (e.g. on a certain species) (both 58%) (Appendix B24). Other features include shared online work on data sets (48%) and the provision of computation capacity for large data sets (45%). Amongst others, also digital identification keys (40%), Web 2.0 (33%) and Web 3.0 (19%) applications were suggested to enhance the acceptance of data. p. 28

The main obstacles for data sharing are the loss of control, possible misinterpretation of one's data by someone else, the time and effort required to prepare a data set for sharing, not being acknowledged for sharing data, missing data standards, missing infrastructure and unclear legal conditions (3.3; Appendix B9, B17). Van House (2002) already mentioned concerns of biodiversity data sharing as “…environmental planning and biodiversity work are highly political, with major environmental and economic consequences. Some respondents were concerned that their work could be used inappropriately, due to either of two causes: technical incompetence; or inappropriate goals and values, such as when data were used to harm environmentallysensitive areas”. p. 28

The control and misinterpretation issues could be partly met by providing optimised communication structures within data portals and clear guidelines for data reuse (see 4.5). However, researchers must accept not to be able to keep control over their data forever without the ultimate loss of that data. Van House (2003) also strengthened the trust aspect by stating “accepting others testimony is, among other things, a strategy of cognitive efficiency. We have neither the ability nor the resources to make all possible observations, develop our own methods, and test all possible knowledge claims”, which is especially true for biodiversity research. However, the lack of acknowledgment is a technical issue which must be addressed by building capacities for data citation within a database. p. 30

In the interviews, the time effort was the most violently discussed obstacle for data sharing and this has been found to be a major issue in other studies as well (Tenopir et al., 2011). Many researchers already feel they have too many responsibilities. The average total time researchers spend with data curation is more than a week per year (3.3; Appendix B10). That German researchers give a much shorter time (less than a day per year) is partly due to the formulation of the question which had a specific focus on preparing data for upload into databases (3.3; Appendix B10). To increase the amount of shared data curation, management and sharing of data has to be better integrated into the researcher's everyday work flow. A first step is that data should be collected already in a database compatible format (databases could provide e.g. exemplary Excel sheets that could then be uploaded directly). This would save time otherwise spent on editing and converting data into the right format. p. 30

 Even though there is a variation between the various professional communities, many researchers feel that there are no data standards within their community (3.3; Appendix B8). Here one has to differentiate between standards in data collection and information technological standards. For the former the communities themselves have to develop standards they would like to use in community driven processes. As an example from molecular biology, the development of standards for the Silva database (www.arb-silva.de, ribosomal RNA database) by the Genomic Standards Consortium (e.g. Kottmann et al., 2008) can be mentioned. Information technological standards are further developed, e.g. TDWG standards that include Darwincore and ABCDDNA (for more information see www.tdwg.org). However, many of these standards are not used by practicing life scientists. p. 30

Missing infrastructure is another problem that should be addressed. In general the majority of researchers have an idea in which database they can deposit their data. But at least 40% of participants do not know about such a database (3.3; Appendix B9), especially high is this percentage with participants that are not willing to share data (3.3, Appendix B9). The logical conclusion is that researchers not willing to share data do not know databases. p. 30","Especially because many researchers stated that a place to deposit data would increase their motivation to do so (Appendix B19). However, existing databases should be better promoted and additional databases should be provided. One problem becoming apparent in the interviews is that there are many very specialised databases that are known by only very few participants. These are often developed by a single person without funding p. 30

The legal framework concerning the ownership of research data before and after deposition in a database is very complex and involves many uncertainties. This is especially so because databases often contain data from different countries and the law can differ considerably from country to country. Furthermore, the law within each country is differently well developed. Also, researchers themselves are not very clear about the ownership of the data they produce (3.3; Appendix 11). p. 30

Researchers are motivated to share data because they would like to use large data sets for comprehensive studies (3.4, Appendix B22). From the interviews we know that research questions for which data would be used include e.g. large scale biodiversity dynamics assessments, habitat modelling or eco- and bio-sociological assessments. Networking with other researchers and increasing one's visibility in the community are also a major motivation (3.4, Appendix B22). This has also been stated by the Vertebrate community which successfully installed the now widely accepted database VertNet (Constable et al., 2010). Arzberger et al. (2004) already stated that appropriate reward structures are a necessary component for promoting data access and sharing practices. p. 31

The participants of our study also felt that the quality of published studies could increase through the transparency of the underlying data sets. Piwowar et al. (2007) demonstrated, that studies with accompanying data sets were available got cited significantly more often than comparable studies where the data sets were not made public, independently from author or the impact factor of the journal. That an increased transparency could also increase the citation frequency could be a huge motivation for researchers to share data. Pressure from external agencies, i.e. “stick” incentives, would include pressure from funding agencies and journals. The German Science Foundation (DFG) by now requires the deposition of data generated within funded projects. p. 31

The development of technical structures must include a discussion of data and metadata categories, researcher's everyday data handling and the attributes a database or data portal should have to guarantee active use by the community. For an information technological evaluation of existing biodiversity data bases please refer to Bach et al. p. 31

A biodiversity data portal should include more than the facility to upload data into a database to ensure active use by the science community. In the interviews, many researchers stated that it would be an improvement, if there would be a biodiversity data portal linking existing databases with each other and facilitating the parallel search of those integrated databases. Currently, researchers have to individually search every data base which is very time consuming. p. 31

Furthermore the quality of the data needs to be secured (3.5; Appendix B21). This could be achieved through data curators employed by the databases/data portal and/or through some peer reviewed process (interviews). p. 31","Clear results were: scientists want repositories for biodiversity data. The responses of interviewed scientist not significantly differed from the online survey, therefore only the latter is discussed in the following part in more detail. p. 26",,yes

However, the scales at which these laws apply are not necessarily relevant to data sharing practice among individuals (e.g., in virtual, social communities). Rather, the data sharing communities and their members often form their own policies, practices and norms governing data sharing. Using common property theory, our research objectives were to determine: (1) parallels between data sharing communities and natural resource-sharing communities; (2) factors that lead to successful data sharing; (3) circumstances under which rules, laws and policies govern data sharing. We used cases from two emerging data sharing communities in the environmental sciences—a micrometeorology community (FLUXNET) and a satellite remote sensing community. Cases of data sharing without conflict or irresolvable disputes had more principles in common with a successfully managed natural resource commons than did those characterized by conflict. Successful data sharing requires that biophysical scientists be more attentive to the social nature of data sharing.",ScienceDirect,Management,"Property Rights, Data commons",,,"CPR design principles are a useful tool for analyzing governance of property. They are conditions associated with the success of voluntary collective management of natural resources by groups of users in accomplishing their outcome. They have been used to analyze common property systems as well as large-scale resources in a global commons. The importance of design principles in successful management has been shown to be highly dependent on the situation. Each of the these design principles can be applied to shared data: 1. Clearly defined boundaries specify who has a right to use a dataset and describe the dataset itself. Datasets should be easily identifiable. Thus poaching can be detected. However, like mobile natural resources, they move or are moved through a territory (cyberspace), which is not easily bounded. The users of shared data may be bounded socially through associations but seldom geographically. A global community may require identifying information before allowing access to data as a means of enforcing boundaries. 2. Appropriation rules related to local conditions occur through national and international laws and treaties. Local communities may augment local rules by using de facto rules. 3. Collective-choice arrangements allow individuals to contribute to modifying the rules. These ensure that each party (data producer and user) benefits from the arrangement as well as being protected. Because data producers have the power to refuse or delay data distribution, they have a major input on how data can be used. 4. Monitoring is needed by the users or people who are accountable to them. Because they are generally physically dispersed, monitors are unlikely to catch poachers in the act of downloading, copying and printing data. Thus unauthorized use can generally only be detected when a manuscript is circulated, reviewed or published. When journals are indexed online, post hoc monitoring becomes relatively easy. Data producers can contact journal editors or publishers with complaints before manuscripts go to final print. 5. Graduated sanctions, depending on the seriousness and context of the offense, should be applied to appropriators, by officials accountable to them, or both. These readily lend themselves to the application of shared data. 6. Conflict-resolution mechanisms should be rapid and low-cost. The global nature of a data sharing community complicates this issue. Universities and institutions in countries with different political regimes may or may not act in response to the actions of local data users and producers. The mechanism of one country or culture may differ from that of another. Intellectual property rights may be ill-defined or even unrecognized. Larger institutional or governance rules may not have a large impact, whereas local norms may have different weights. 7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize. The rights of institutions and informal groups to devise their own rules is usually recognized but is complicated globally. The recognition of rights, rules, and conflict-resolution mechanisms varies internationally. However, a virtual community may be able to develop and follow its own norms without coming under governmental scrutiny or sanction p. 239-",,,yes

Karami et al. 2012,2012,Using GIS servers and interactive maps in spectral data sharing and administration: Case study of Ahvaz Spectral Geodatabase Platform (ASGP),Computers & Geosciences,Remote sensing Spectral database Metadata Web-GIS,Journal paper,"With emergence of air-borne and space-borne hyperspectral sensors, spectroscopic measurements are gaining more importance in remote sensing. Therefore, the number of available spectral reference data is constantly increasing. This rapid increase often exhibits a poor data management, which leads to ultimate isolation of data on disk storages. Spectral data without precise description of the target, methods, environment, and sampling geometry cannot be used by other researchers. Moreover, existing spectral data (in case it accompanied with good documentation) become virtually invisible or unreachable for researchers. Providing documentation and a data-sharing framework for spectral data, in which researchers are able to search for or share spectral data and documentation, would definitely improve the data lifetime. Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are main candidates for spectral data management and their efficiency is proven by many studies and applications to date. In this study, a new approach to spectral data administration is presented based on spatial identity of spectral samples. This method benefits from scalability and performance of RDBMS for storage of spectral data, but uses GIS servers to provide users with interactive maps as an interface to the system. The spectral files, photographs and descriptive data are considered as belongings of a geospatial object. A spectral processing unit is responsible for evaluation of metadata quality and performing routine spectral processing tasks for newly-added data. As a result, by using internet browser software the users would be able to visually examine availability of data and/or search for data based on descriptive attributes associated to it. The proposed system is scalable and besides giving the users good sense of what data are available in the database, it facilitates participation of spectral reference data in producing geoinforma- tion.",ScienceDirect,Computer & Geo Science,"Administration; CasestudyofAhvazSpectralGeodatabase

Using standard qualitative methods, we chronicled project milestones, and identified 31 “critical incidents” that delayed or prevented their achievement. We then used these critical incidents to articulate six organizational capacity domains associated with the achievement of project milestones, and a seventh domain consisting of organizational incentives. Finally, we analyzed the relationship of milestone achievement to the presence of these capacities and incentives.

We assume that a set of access rules is given to the parties to regulate the data sharing, and such rules are defined over the join operations over the relational data. It is expected that the access rules will be designed according to business needs of the involved enterprises and although some negotiation between them will be involved, only a comprehensive analysis of the rules can uncover all issues of consistency between rules and their adequacy in answering the authorized queries (which we call enforceability).

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuro- imaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical im- aging datasets, the FCP and INDI have demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embrace- ment of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls.",ScienceDirect,NeuroImage,"Over a decade ago, the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) pioneered open-access data sharing in the task-based functional neuroimaging community.",no method,"Protecting privacy in an open science community Individuals around the world voluntarily participate in research protocols to advance scientific understanding and its practical applications. At the core of this contract is the promise of privacy and respect of confidentiality — with respect to both an individual's enrollment in a specific study and any information obtained in the course of participation. The most salient risk of open-access data sharing is the very real potential of breaching participant privacy (Navarro, 2008). Image headers can contain a wealth of information about participants (e.g., name or identification code, date of birth, scan date, weight, etc.) some of which can be used to identify specific individuals. Additionally, high-resolution structural images can enable identification via 3D facial reconstruction. p. 688

Additionally, it highlights the need for researchers around the world to adjust their consent process immediately to inform participants that their brain imaging and phenotypic data may be shared, whether in the short run, or one or more years after study completion and publication of initial findings. p. 688","Infrastructure: Improving mechanisms for data contribution and distribution An optimal sharing platform provides a powerful, easy-to-use database that is readily searchable, while automatically maintaining quality control and data integrity (Poline et al., 2012). At the same time, the platform should make it easy for researchers to share data, ideally through a simple one-click upload, with automatic data verification thereafter (Poline et al., 2012). p. 688

It is our belief that funding agencies and scientific journals must work together to advance the implementation of an open science agenda in the imaging community. The maintenance and sharing of data is costly. Funding agencies must approach this responsibility seriously by providing the additional costs associated with open science, with the long-term perspective of excellent return on investment. This may be a hard proposition at a time of economic stringency but, in the long term, this will save money that can be put to use in generating much needed data that can be readily used by many in the open science model. Still, the mere distribution of funds to support open science is not enough. Funding agencies must track scientific impact beyond simple citation numbers p. 689",,,yes

Therefore, there is a compelling need to develop an efficient and user- friendly information management system to handle the biomedical research data. This study evaluated the implementation of an information management system, which was introduced as part of the collabo- rative research to increase scientific productivity in a research laboratory.

This study raises the next question of intervention to incorporate certain features into information management systems for improved collaboration among distributed research sites as well as within the laboratories. Such interventions should at least enable us to: • Achieve common terminologies, distributed workflows: this can solve some problems of collaboration between geographically distributed researchers from same domain; • Utilize visualization functionalities: such visualization aids can address the needs of researchers collaborating with specialists from other domains. • Develop newer tools to support publication lifecycle, literature review, authoring, and simultaneous easy access to research data, results, and interpretations; Deploy metadata like entities to cover a range of heterogeneous biomedical data derived from several distributed sources. • Personalize research information while imposing proper structure on data handled by a laboratory researcher, such an option would reduce problems arising from idiosyncratic ways of information management. p. 263","

A recent National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) survey is exploring attitudes in detail (S.

Non-author contributors, whether groups or in- dividuals, should not be added to the author list of published papers. Deviation from these principles de- values authorship and raises issues, such as equal treatment of groups and individuals, credit for shared data vs. other shared resources, and ultimately guest authorship. Such dilution of authorship standards is problematic because it can compromise fair evaluations in the scientific community.

While this case is not specifically addressed in the ICMJE criteria, the Journal of the American Medical Association, in its “Instructions for Authors”,8 is more specific and requires that either “all members of the group must meet the full criteria and requirements for authorship as described above” or, in the alternative, the group “must designate 1 or more individuals as authors or members of a writing group who meet full authorship criteria and requirements.” p. 4191","The traditional and most commonly used form of crediting data obtained from others is by naming the source of the data in the Acknowledgments section of a paper, as is recommended by the ICMJE (see above).

Recommendations from the Toronto International Data Release Workshop (Toronto International Data Release Workshop Authors et al., 2009), organized by Genome Canada, the Wellcome Trust, and other funding agencies, favor credit by citation. To this end, a socalled marker paper should be published by the data sharing initiative ahead of the data release, which describes “the data set to be produced, the associated metadata, the experimental design, pilot data, data standards, security, quality-control procedures, expected timelines, data release mechanisms and contact details for lead investigators.” A less common but more visible attribution of a primary source for a paper is to mention it in the paper title. This type of attribution is used, for example, by the Osteoarthritis Initiative15 (e.g., Eckstein et al., 2009).

Numbers of researchers in the natural sciences express their concerns over the issue of ineffective sharing infrastructures, more specifically related to the data architecture and data protection (Nelson, 2009; Schofield et al., 2009). In terms of data protection, researchers often question the existence of a mechanism that would guarantee that data will not be scooped, poached, or misused (Nelson, 2009; Van House, Butler, & Schiff, 1998), and that freely shared data will indeed be used ethically and responsibly (Schofield et al., 2009). Similarly, the PARSE Insight survey suggested that misuse of data becomes the major concern for scientists publishing their research data to the public (Kuipers & van der Hoeven, 2009). The technology to support the protection of their data once it is made available to the public significantly influences their willingness to share the data openly (Nelson, 2009). The second major issue is related to data architecture, in particular the issue of data quality and standardization. Assurance of data quality and compatibility are pertinent not only to the scientific data sharing domain but also to interagency information sharing. There are two aspects which influence effective sharing, namely: sufficiency of data or information quality and compatibility/standardization. Inconsistencies of data definition and content could challenge the integration of a large volume of different forms of data from organizationally and geographically dispersed origins (Pardo, Cresswell, Dawes, & Burke, 2004). The expected result from data reuse and sharing can be distorted when the data sources have different formats, definitions and contexts resulting in disjointed information. This is especially critical considering the heterogeneity and complexity of data in earth and environmental science (Reichman et al., 2011). Thus, a degree of standardization of the procedure for data management becomes a prerequisite for data sharing (Postle, Shapiro, & Biesanz, 2002). The standardization and increased quality of data is achievable by creating more attention to the usability and user-friendliness of metadata management and increasing skills for data management (Michener, 2006). Similarly, the heterogeneity and complexity of earth and environment data influences the concern for preserving data quality. The literature pointed at researchers' perception that no one other than themselves could understand the data because their primary data is far too complex for others to understand (Koslow, 2000, 2002). And vice versa, the researchers also expressed their distrust or limited understanding of the data produced by others (Koslow, 2002). The issue of preserving data quality to avoid misinterpretation once again points at the significance of data management skills. The concern over misinterpretation of the data can be mitigated if the description of relevant experimental conditions and variables are clearly specified and explained in the data sets (Koslow, 2002). p. 21

Social/Organizational: Four aspects of organizational and economic barriers have been found to discourage sharing: 1) cost of sharing, 2) incentives and merit system, 3) the culture of open sharing, and 4) structural conflicts and managerial practices in organization. Researchers argue for the logistic barriers to data sharing (Parr & Cummings, 2005). Cost and incentives for sharing the research data become one of the major barriers to sharing research data. Based on a national survey of 3000 scientists, Campbell et al. (2002) found that the majority of scientists were withholding their data and refusing to share because of lack of resources (Campbell et al., 2002). Scientists tend to deny requests to share data due to the costs of complying with such requests in terms of time and effort (Postle et al., 2002; Vision, 2010). Data documentation is a labor-intensive process (Borgman, 2010) and researchers need to prepare data sets before they are readily available for sharing (Nelson, 2009), not to mention that some data and materials are costly (Blumenthal, Campbell, Anderson, Causino, & Louis, 1997), and some of these data are collected over the lifetime of the researchers. The reluctance to share is also due to the current lack of sufficient rewards and incentives for researchers to do so (Koslow, 2000, 2002). The composition of incentives and rewards in the scientific world range greatly from financial incentives to reputation and public recognition. Birnholtz and Bietz (2003) argue that research data sets accrue “monopoly rents” for scientists. Monopoly rents refer to the creation of a monopoly situation, that is, exclusive control over resources, which typically generate higher real income (Krueger, 1974). Thus, there is a possibility that a scientist's ability to maintain exclusive control over his or her data will significantly correlate to the financial interest of the researchers or their home organization (Birnholtz & Bietz, 2003; Blumenthal et al., 1997). The researchers might be concerned about losing patent rights or securing future grants/funding (Ceci, 1988; Rodriguez, 2009). The other types of incentives relate to reputation and merit. Competition for merit and reputation is more aggressive in the scientific field, which contributes to stronger resistance to data sharing (Birnholtz & Bietz, 2003). Researchers and scientists in the academic world rely on their reputations to signify prominence, and to act as a warranty of the quality of their work (Ding, Levin, Stephan, & Winkler, 2010). The researcher's reputation depends on his or her ability to understand data, and the consequent generation of publications based on the research data (Tucker, 2009). As such, Ardichvili, Page, and Wentling (2003) found, in the virtual community of practice, “fear of losing face” to be the most important barrier in sharing data/information (Ardichvili et al., 2003, p. 70). The fear that someone elsemight find different results, or something that the researcher missed which would undermine the previous publication and pre-empt subsequent publications, significantly affects their propensity to share (Koslow, 2000, 2002). The researchers also have concerns that procedural and computational errors will be discovered (Ceci &Walker, 1983). Similarly, personal recognition and public appreciation significantly affects the desire to make the data publicly available. Promotion for academe is tied to publication and not data, which makes publishing data sets less advantageous for scientists (Borgman, 2010; Rodriguez, 2009). In addition, data is viewed as private intellectual property regardless of the funding sources (Nelkin, 1982) and is tied to personal glory and recognition. For instance, Barnes (1987) found that the motivation for personal recognition significantly affects researchers' willingness to share AIDS research data (Barnes, 1987). Finally, data sets might be stored in the researchers' home institution. As a result, there exist administrative reasons for refusal to share data, such as security reasons for non-release (Ceci & Walker, 1983) or protection of institutional financial interests (Blumenthal et al., 1997). The individual researcher might be constrained by their institutional policies in sharing the data (Tenopir et al., 2011). On the other hand, this issue might not hold in the future. With the contention that research data funded by public funding is regarded as a public good and should be made openly available, the availability of data should only be restricted by legitimate considerations such as protection of national security (Arzberger et al., 2004). For instance, starting from January 18, 2011, all NSF funded research should include supplementary documents detailing the data management plan. p. 21

Legal: Legal and policy can both enhance and inhibit data sharing. Researchers could use the rigidity of policies and regulations as legitimate reasons for not sharing their data under the pretext of confidentiality or legal rights (Savage & Vickers, 2009). The liabilities associated with the breach of privacy deter researchers fromsharing their data sets publicly (Tucker, 2009) and “de-identifying” sensitive data could take a lot of time (Vickers, 2006). Thus, there is a trade-off between the vagueness of sharing policies and the flexibility of sharing (Nelson, 2009). On the other hand, learning from the lesson from inter-agency information sharing, legal regulation and policy is necessary to enhance data sharing by ensuring proper and accountable use of data and information, considering that lack of policies does not guarantee a neutral sharing environment (Zhang & Dawes, 2006). In fact, unresolved legal issues can deter or restrain the development of collaboration, even if scientists are prepared to proceed (Bos et al., 2007). Thus, the legal and policy requirements could actually mitigate the primary concerns of data being scooped, misused or misinterpreted. Policies for data management and regulation to protect confidentiality and privacy have a crucial role in supporting data accessibility (Arzberger et al., 2004).

Local contexts: Local contexts and specificity are regarded as the distinctive challenges to data sharing in the natural sciences. By nature, data in earth and environment domains are heterogeneous and complex (Reichman et al., 2011). The data collection process in earth and environment domains are extremely complex and significantly influenced by the local context where the data is collected (Zimmerman, 2007, 2008). Borgman (2010) points to four dimensions pertinent to the difficulties in sharing due to the complexity of data, namely: specificity of purpose, specificity of events, specificity of methodology, and the duration of research. Natural scientists usually pursue a specific question at a specific site about a specific phenomenon; therefore, each subject might have different characteristics and require a different methodology (Borgman, 2010). There are primary concerns expressed by researchers who pointed out that details and local contexts underlying the data are often unknown (Smith, Seligman, & Swarup, 2008) and not captured in the secondary data (Borgman, 2010; Zimmerman, 2007, 2008). This condition results in accentuating the fear of data misinterpretation and misuse because the data will not be easily understood by others (Koslow, 2000, 2002). According to the intrinsic data quality pattern formulated by Strong, Lee, and Wang (1997) local context and judgment will eventually lead to data not being used, due to little added value or poor reputation (Strong et al., 1997). Strong et al. (1997) argued that local contexts from multiple sources of data will lead to questionable believability of data, resulting in poor application and little added value. Similarly, the involvement of judgment in data production will result in questionable objectivity and believability of data that lead to poor application, little added value, and eventually, data uselessness (Strong et al., 1997).

The disconnected cluster suggests that sharing is actually somewhat limited and that a number of specific factors that limit data sharing may be operating in the network. This suggests that there exist certain challenges that restrict the propensity of researchers to share. In this regard, the next section outlines the challenges, as identified in survey results, of sharing research data sets openly with the public. p. 25

In terms of organizational involvement, the survey results indicated that 57% of the respondents noted the importance of receiving technical support for data management during the period of the project, while only 43% noted the importance of technical support for data management beyond the life of the project. Similarly, 51% of the respondents noted the significance of having organizational support in terms of data management. In addition, 46% of the respondents found organizational support for data storage during the life of the project to be important. On the other hand, organizational funding and training support for data management were regarded as less important determinants. By averaging the respondents' responses on the two questions related to funding, between 60% and 70% of the responses showed organizational support for funding and training for data management to be of lesser importance than the other determinants. The majority of respondents expressed the importance of appreciation and acknowledgement of data owners in the process of reusing data; 93% indicated the significance of a formal acknowledgement to the data owner. The respondents also indicated the importance of collaboration in terms of co-authorship on publications (60%). The majority of respondents (70%) noted that acknowledgement in terms of cost recovery or other economic purposes is not important p. 25

Data management skills: In this study the technological barriers were measured in terms of data management skills and data management tools. An average of the responses from three questions on searching, collecting, and cataloging data, shows that 85% of the respondents seem to agree on the importance of data management skills in the form of searching, collecting, and cataloging the data. 85% of the respondents also expressed the significance of skills in storing research data sets during the life of the project, but the significance of this skill becomes less important (56%) after the project is over. Interestingly, 82% of respondents pointed out that the lack of data standards is not an important determinant in the propensity to publish research data sets online (Table 4). p. 25

Legal/policy related challenges: In terms of legal and policy issues related to publishing research data sets online, the majority recognize the significance of citation, legal agreement, statement of use, conditions of use, and approval for reuse. 98% of the respondents indicated the importance of citations when using the data sets from another researcher. In addition, 62% indicated that a review from data set owners should be required before results of data sets' reuse are disseminated, and that reprints of products from data sets' reuse must be provided to data set owners (70%). The respondents also indicated that statements of use and agreement on statements of use should be required before reusing data sets (67%). In addition, the respondents agreed that legal agreements should be obtained for data sets' reuse (45%) and approval from the owner of data is a must (48%). If the respondents are required to publish their data sets, 82% of respondents asserted that conditions should be placed on access when data sets are made available (Table 5). p. 26

The majority of respondents acknowledged the presence of a fear of data misinterpretation and misuse. 91% of respondents indicated concerns that data may be used in ways that were not initially intended. Additionally, the majority of respondents noted that their fear that data may be misinterpreted came from either the poor quality of the data (87%) or because of the complexity of the data itself (90%) (Table 6). The descriptive statistics show that the majority of respondents found several potential challenges to be significant determinants of publishing research data sets openly to the public. These descriptive results support the initial visualization of the 2-mode network which highlights the potential of several determinants to be challenges and inhibitors of data sharing. p. 26

Sullivan et al. 2008,2008,Forecast evaluation with shared data sets,International Journal of Forecasting,Forecast evaluation; Bootstrap; Data sharing; Calendar effects; Technical trading; Data mining,Journal paper,"Data sharing is common practice in forecasting experiments in situations where fresh data samples are difficult or expensive to generate. This means that forecasters often analyze the same data set using a host of different models and sets of explanatory variables. This practice introduces statistical dependencies across forecasting studies that can severely distort statistical inference. Here we examine a new and inexpensive recursive bootstrap procedure that allows forecasters to account explicitly for these dependencies. The procedure allows forecasters to merge empirical evidence and draw inference in the light of previously accumulated results. In an empirical example, we merge results from predictions of daily stock prices based on (1) technical trading rules and (2) calendar rules, demonstrating both the significance of problems arising from data sharing and the simplicity of accounting for data sharing using these new methods.",ScienceDirect,Forecasting,,,,,,,

Lessons learned from the fMRIDC,NeuroImage,"Neuroimaging, Databasing, Data sharing, Neuroinformatics",Journal paper,"Neuroimaging and the discipline of cognitive neuroscience have grown together in lock-step with each pushing the other toward an improved ability to explore and examine brain function and form. However successful neuroimaging and the examination of cognitive processes may seem today, the culture of data sharing in these fields remains underdeveloped. In this article, we discuss our own experience in the development of the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) — a large-scale effort to gather, curate, and openly share the complete data sets from published research articles of brain activation studies using fMRI. We outline the fMRIDC effort's beginnings, how it operated, note some of the sociological reactions we received, and provide several examples of prominent new studies performed using data drawn from the archive. Finally, we provide comment on what considerations are needed for successful neuroimaging databasing and data sharing as existing and emerging efforts take the next steps in archiving and disseminating the field's valuable and irreplaceable data.",ScienceDirect,NeuroImaging,"In this article, we discuss our own experience in the development of the fMRI Data Center (fMRIDC) — a large-scale effort to gather, curate, and openly share the complete data sets from published research articles of brain activation studies using fMRI.",Review,"data sharing sociology: Data ownership issues were among the many initial concerns people had about the fMRIDC. We handled this particular issue through an embargo process which allowed for up to six months post-article publication for authors to conduct any other analyses they had planned. This would allay the fears of researchers who imagined working tirelessly on a follow-up project, only to have someone else beat them to the punch by publishing on the results of their data first. p. 679

One aspect of data sharing became abundantly clear to us very soon after getting underway — it turns out that people are not very good at managing their own data. We were amazed by the variety of ways in which neuroimaging data sets were contributed to the archive and how they were stored. We received data on tape, DVD, CD, and, of course, via FTP/SCP. However, it was not uncommon for researchers to give up entirely attempting to organize their data for submission and they literally pulled the hard drives from their computers and mailed them to us! File formats varied widely and file structures even more. p. 679

Voluntary sharing of data may be the ideal, but many researchers find themselves very busy and, given the choice of how to spend their time, may not find the benefits to the community to be compelling enough to make the effort. Additionally, only having data from a “coalition of the willing” may not fully capture the breadth and depth of imaging experimental methods being applied across the field. On the other hand, sharing required as a condition of funding or journal publication can ensure a steady stream of data. However, the mere fact that sharing is required may be met with resistance and prove to be unpopular. Working closely with funding agencies and/or journal editors will be an important element in such instances. Depending on busy investigators to re-format their data specifically for your database is unlikely to be a soundmodel. For every investigator, there is every type of organizational scheme and to create a universal data entry method or ontological structure, despite some progress in this regard (Bug et al., 2008; Turner et al., 2010), remains massively complex and has the potential to be an obstacle to innovation and progression.While electronic data capture methods have a very important role to play (Turner and Van Horn, 2012), it is essential to have dedicated human curators ensuring the consistency of the data, troubleshooting format issues, interacting with the contributing authors, and extracting useful meta-data to summarize the study. If we are to move beyond anonymous FTP-based file repositories, such guided organization and standards for curation will be critical (Van Horn and Ball, 2008; Van Horn and van Pelt, 2008). p. 681",,,,yes

","Of course, there may be insurmountable reasons not to share the data. You may not own the data to begin with. Or sharing may be hampered by ethical considerations relating to privacy. The data may be part of a longitudinal study that will be featured in other articles, and are thus part of an ongoing project. Perhaps you are hesitant to share your data for other reasons. You probably invested considerable time and resources in collecting and analyzing the data, and may therefore consider yourself the rightful owner (even if, say, the taxpayer helped finance the data). You may be afraid that some nitpicking statistician may one day discover an error in one of the statistical analyses that you reported in your paper or that a researcher with opposing views will disagree with your analyses. You may feel that you will be able to publish another paper with the data, provided you had the time. You may consider it too much trouble to document the data properly, which clearly takes time and effort. But such impediments to data sharing may be petty when compared to the benefits of sharing p. 73","You may not realize that there are many advantages to publishing the data following publication. First, the required data archiving, i.e., making them suitable for dissemination, ensures that your data are not (ultimately) lost. One of us once requested data from a close colleague, who responded: “Sure I will send you those data, but it's like seven computers ago, and so please allow me some time to hunt them down”. Apparently, archiving is not every psychologist's cup of tea; in a survey among 192 Dutch research psychologists, two thirds indicated to not archive their data (Voorbrood, 2010). [...] When Wicherts et al. requested data from141 psychological researchers back in 2005 (Wicherts, Borsboom, Kats, & Molenaar, 2006), the relevant papers had been published less than 12 months earlier and only 27% of the researchers were willing and able to share (some of) their data. The low response rate was mostly due to the disappearance of the data and researchers' failure to document the data file in an accessible format. Only a small number of researchers flatly refused p. 74

Second, sharing the data is consistent with the universal scientific norms of openness and rigor. We recently found that psychologists who fail to share their data after publication commit considerably more errors in the reporting of statistical results and report findings that are more likely to be debatable (Wicherts, Bakker, & Molenaar, 2011). Openness with respect to data is good for you and scientific progress, while concealment may facilitate all sorts of trouble, including faulty analyses, overly positive reporting of results, and even misconduct (Wicherts, 2011). p. 74

 Third, publishing one's data has been shown to increase citation scores of the papers which first feature the data (Piwowar, Day, & Fridsma, 2007). So sharing is good for the publishing journal and it is good for the citation score on your resume. Notwithstanding our critique of Lynn and Vanhanen's (2006) work on national IQ (e.g., Wicherts, Dolan, Carlson, & van der Maas, 2010), their work was followed up by many researchers simply because Lynn and Vanhanen published their data in an accessible form. p. 74

Fourth, sharing the data encourages more research because it enables secondary (novel) analyses, for which you may currently lack time, knowledge, expertise, or even interest. Advances in both statistical techniques and knowledge of our research topic will certainly open up novel possibilities with your data in the future. We are sure that many of your colleagues, who use your published data for novel analyses, will have the courtesy to ask you to join the novel research project (as happened in, e.g., Dolan et al., 2006). Besides, having first-hand knowledge of the data, plus possible relevant background information, your help may be essential in those future studies. p. 74

Fifth, sharing the data facilitates subsequent reanalyses, which may have diverse beneficial results. On the one hand they may result in the correction of potential errors in the analyses and in the reporting of results (which are quite common; Bakker & Wicherts, 2011; Wicherts et al., 2011) and may even help prevent such errors in the first place (Wicherts, 2011). On the other hand, reanalyses may emphasize the robustness of your original substantive results. Of course, laying oneself open to criticism and subsequent correction is good scientific practice, but psychologically not necessarily palatable. p. 74


Sixth, many funding agencies including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Science Foundation (NSF), the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), and the Netherlands Organization for Research (NWO) in our country have stipulated that grantees should either write a data sharing plan as part of proposals or make the data publically available upon completion of the project. In fact, you are already obliged keep your data in accessible form for at least five years and to share your data for verification purposes upon request (American Psychological Association, 2010). Obviously: you need not worry about such stipulations, if you routinely submit your data along with your paper. p. 74

Bezuidenhout 2013,2013,Data Sharing and Dual-Use Issues,Science and Engineering Ethics,Dual-use  Data sharing  Ethics  Responsibility,Paper,"The concept of dual-use encapsulates the potential for well-intentioned, beneficial scientific research to also be misused by a third party for malicious ends. The concept of dual-use challenges scientists to look beyond the immediate outcomes of their research and to develop an awareness of possible future (mis)uses of scientific research. Since 2001 much attention has been paid to the possible need to regulate the dual-use potential of the life sciences. Regulation initiatives fall under two broad categories—those that develop the ethical education of scientists and foster an awareness and responsibility of dual-use issues, and those which assess the regulation of information being generated by current research. Both types of initiatives are premised on a cautious, risk-adverse philosophy which advocates careful examination of all future endpoints of research endeavors. This caution advocated within initiatives such as pre-publication review of journal articles contrasts to the obligation to share underpinning data sharing discussions. As the dual-use debate has yet to make a significant impact on data sharing discussions (and vice versa) it is possible that these two areas of knowledge control may present areas of ethical conflict for scientists, and thus need to be more closely examined. This paper examines the tension between the obligation to share exemplified by data sharing principles and the concerns raised by the risk-cautious culture of the dual-use debates. The paper concludes by reflecting on the issues of responsibility as raised by dual-use as relating to data sharing, such as the chain of custody for shared data.",Springer,Ethics,"The concept of misuse of scientific information is not new and indeed, hesitations regarding the negative use of research findings have been recorded throughout the centuries.

Breeze et al. 2012,2012,,Giga Science,"Neuroimaging, Neuroscience, Data sharing, Data publishing, Standards",Commentary,"There is growing recognition of the importance of data sharing in the neurosciences, and in particular in the field of neuroimaging research, in order to best make use of the volumes of human subject data that have been acquired to date. However, a number of barriers, both practical and cultural, continue to impede the widespread practice of data sharing; these include: lack of standard infrastructure and tools for data sharing, uncertainty about how to organize and prepare the data for sharing, and researchers’ fears about unattributed data use or missed opportunities for publication. A further challenge is how the scientific community should best describe and/or reference shared data that is used in secondary analyses. Finally, issues of human research subject protections and the ethical use of such data are an ongoing source of concern for neuroimaging researchers. One crucial issue is how producers of shared data can and should be acknowledged and how this important component of science will benefit individuals in their academic careers. While we encourage the field to make use of these opportunities for data publishing, it is critical that standards for metadata, provenance, and other descriptors are used. This commentary outlines the efforts of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing to coordinate and establish such standards, as well as potential ways forward to relieve the issues that researchers who produce these massive, reusable community resources face when making the data rapidly and freely available to",Springer,Neuroscience,,no method; ,"Over the past two years, the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (http://www.incf.org) has investigated barriers to data sharing through task force working groups and public workshops, and has identified a number of roadblocks, many of which are readily addressable, that impede researchers from both sharing and making use of existing shared data. These include a lack of simple tools for finding, uploading, and downloading shared data; uncertainty about how to best organize and prepare data for sharing, and concerns about data attribution. Many researchers are also wary of data sharing because of confusion institutional human research subject protection and the ethical use of such data [2]. p. 1

While the lack of tools is an obvious barrier, it is one that we feel can be readily addressed by efforts such as that of INCF and similar initiatives [7-9]. A greater challenge will be the current academic and funding framework in which most researchers exist, which equates career advancement with some count of peerreviewed publications. Given this climate, it is a great step forward for the community that peer-reviewed journals are now offering an article type devoted to the description and publication of data, along with recommendation of organizations such as DataCite. This follows similar journal initiatives to publish papers on software code and technology methods, and signifies a stronger valuation of the computational and technical work that makes up a large part of modern biomedical research. p. 3
","Data citation: A growing and crucial issue is how producers of shared data can and should be acknowledged by third parties who publish papers based on this data. Without such acknowledgement, very little data will ever be shared. A number of journals have launched a new type of articles devoted to the description and/or publication of original datasets [3,4]. The benefit of using a publication to ‘mark’ a data release is that credit and reuse are fairly easily tracked with traditional citation and impact metrics. With its ability to host large datasets, GigaScience offers neuroimaging researchers another option to store and share their data, and provides such datasets a digital object identifier. p. 2

from the coordinates alone was poor. There is little doubt that more and more neuroimaging data will be shared. For example, increased attention to the importance of reproducible research [6] has helped to encourage that data and analysis tools are made available as supplementary material at the time of publication. Another impetus is the need for many projects to gather data and communicate with collaborators. Whenever the scientific questions require a large number of scans, longitudinal data, or a very specific patient population that cannot be recruited at one site, researchers from consortia need standard tools to share and curate data and computational tools. p. 3",,,yes
Duri et al. 2004,2004,Search ResultsData protection and data sharing in telematics,Mobile Networks and Applications,,Lecture notes,"Automotive telematics may be defined as the information-intensive applications enabled for vehicles by a combination of telecommunications
and computing technology. Telematics by its nature requires the capture, storage, and exchange of sensor data to obtain remote
services. Such data likely include personal, sensitive information, which require proper handling to protect the driver’s privacy. Some existing
approaches focus on protecting privacy through anonymous interactions or by stopping information flow altogether. We complement
these by concentrating instead on giving different stakeholders control over data sharing and use. In this paper, we identify several data
protection challenges specifically related to the automotive telematics domain, and propose a general data protection framework to address
some of those challenges. The framework enables data aggregation before data is released to service providers, which minimizes the disclosure
of privacy sensitive information. We have implemented the core component, the privacy engine, to help users manage their privacy
policies and to authorize data requests based on policy matching. The policy manager provides a flexible privacy policy model that allows
data subjects to express rich constraint-based policies, including event-based, and spatio-temporal constraints. Thus, the policy engine can
decide on a large number of requests without user assistance and causes no interruptions while driving. A performance study indicates that

",Springer,,,,"Misuse/Uncertainty: Most academic institutions that have a research review process (Ethics Review Board in Canada, Internal Review Board in the USA) hold the person who creates the data set responsible for making sure its confidentiality is not violated and that the data is used for the research purposes it was initially intended for. This often takes the form of a signed contractual engagement, where the researcher formally promises to put in place the countermeasures necessary to ensure appropriate use and confidentiality. In addition, the researcher must guarantee that the human subjects that may have participated in the creation of the data set have given their free and informed consent for the use of that data for that particular intended research purpose. But what if the researcher desires to share the data with another researcher? How can the standards imposed upon the originating research be compared with those of the receiving party? How can he guarantee that the data will be used for that same purpose? Furthermore, there are many sensitive data sets in computer security research that do not involve human subjects, and might therefore not fall within the purview or the mandate of such a research review process. Examples of such sensitive data include malware collections, information about unpatched system vulnerabilities, system configuration of systems under study, or even information about criminal activity discovered in the context of research, the release of which could have negative consequences for third parties or even the public at large. p. 137

This is also the case for the examination of the receiving researchers’ security policy and security counter-measures. Do the lab facilities of the receiving researcher allow for the proper containment and protection of the data? Do the physical, logical and personnel security policies of the receiving lab/organization adequately reduce the risk that an internal or external party access and potentially release the data in an unauthorized fashion? This verification can be somewhat difficult, mostly because security laboratories should indeed protect the confidentiality of their own security measures, and hence sharing details about them with other researchers for the purposes of gaining access to their data does potentially increase risk. In some sense the receiving researcher should ask himself whether the originator can be trusted not only with information about security policy but also about time-sensitive ideas about research projects that the originator could easily use to his own benefit. p. 138

Privacy: For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines represent an almost universal list of privacy principles: collection limitation, data quality, purpose specification, use limitation, security safeguards, openness, individual participation, and accountability. Organizations adopting and implementing these principles will be well on the way to establishing good privacy protection. p. 139",,,,yes
Freymann et al. 2012,2012,Image Data Sharing for Biomedical Research—Meeting,Journal of Digital Imaging ,-,Journal,"Data sharing is increasingly recognized as critical to cross-disciplinary research and to assuring scientific validity. Despite National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation policies encouraging data sharing by grantees, little data sharing of clinical data has in fact occurred. A principal reason often given is the potential of inadvertent violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations. While regulations specify the components of private health information that should be protected, there are no commonly accepted methods to de-identify clinical data objects such as images. This leads institutions to take conservative risk-averse positions on data sharing. In imaging trials, where images are coded according to the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard, the complexity of the data objects and the flexibility of the DICOM standard have made it especially difficult to meet privacy protection objectives. The recent release of DICOM Supplement 142 on image de-identification has removed much of this impediment. This article describes the development of an open-source software suite that implements DICOM Supplement 142 as part of the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA). It also describes the lessons learned by the authors as NBIA has acquired more than 20 image collections encompassing over 30 million images.",Springer,Imaging Informatics,-,-,"Nevertheless, little data sharing has occurred outside the framework of prearranged links between research groups. One reason for the unwillingness of institutions to share clinical research data is the variety of local interpretations of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations enforced by HHS Office of Civil Rights. In this environment, the most comfortable stance for institutional IT departments has been to adopt risk-averse postures [2]. p. 15


Technical barriers: Clinical trials and other research-driven image collection activities often produce a combination of image and nonimage data objects. Preserving the interrelationships between these objects while de-identifying their PHI is challenging. Images are typically encapsulated in DICOM datasets that contain identifiers for a trial, a patient, a study, a series (of images), etc. Increasingly, non-image data objects are encapsulated in XML files p. 16

Data Transmission: Most clinical image data transfer on the Internet requires the penetration of at least one firewall. Most projects employ software that makes outbound connections from the secure network at the image acquisition sites to the principal investigator site. This relieves the image acquisition sites from having to open a port to the Internet, but it requires one port to be open to the Internet at the principal investigator site—a requirement that some IT departments are unwilling to support (see Fig. 1). Some clinical trial transfer packages allow two programs to run together at the principal investigator site to pull data into the secure network from the DMZ without having to open a port to the secure network.","De-identification The objective of de-identification is to ensure that data objects cannot be connected to a specific human subject [11]. The HIPAA Privacy Rule [12] defines two approaches to removal of PHI: one that leaves the decision as to what constitutes PHI to a nominal expert and the other that predefines 18 categories of identifiers to specifically remove or conceal, i.e., p. 16

Do Not Overdo De-identification Image collections generally contain data from many patients, each often having multiple studies and series. To maximize the benefits of such collections, the identifiers in the data objects must retain the ability to distinguish among patients, studies of a single patient, etc. Any implementation of the Supplement 142 profiles must be careful to provide pseudonyms for such identifiers rather than fixed values. For example, if every patient ID were named to the same value, then most DICOM software would treat your entire dataset as though it consisted of only a single patient. p. 22","In the science community, mainstream stakeholders like NIH, FDA researchers, PhRMA, and the device industry continue to emphasize the importance of data and image sharing in policy statements. New societal attitudes toward funding science have focused renewed attention to data sharing as a way to break down silos, accelerate progress, and reduce research redundancy [3]. Besides access to a greater universe of data available for research purposes and assuring the validity of scientific claims, data sharing provides other advantages to individual researchers by producing more citations [4, 5]. Biomedical research containing clinical data in particular motivates new justification for encouraging data sharing since the bedrock of disease-based clinical genetics and cellular discovery rests on data derived from human subjects. Moreover, genetic research must rely on large population sample sizes, making conclusions derived from such data too costly to replicate by other investigators. The data from each individual is obtained at great cost and effort. If such data were sequestered in small isolated collections and cannot be cross-queried, the research community suffers. p. 15

Data sharing is central to science, and we agree that data should be made available. As investigators funded by the NIH’s Human Brain Project, we have promoted data sharing and thus applaud the initiation of a meaningful datasharing policy. We have also explored related technical and sociological benefits and barriers, and our support is coupled to proposals for improvement and extension of the policy and guidelines. This perspective is based on our experience advancing the field of neuroinformatics and thus it is proper that we use the pages of Neuroinformatics to advance it. We offer this perspective as a private effort on our part, not an NIH-sponsored or initiated activity. Our goal is to ensure that data sharing is, and is recognized to be, effective and rewarding.",Springer,Neuroinformatics,"Recently issued NIH policy statement and implementation guidelines (National Institutes of Health, 2003) promote the sharing of research data.

Data sharing permits reanalyses and meta-analyses beyond the expertise or time constraints of the original data collectors. Informed by shared data, new hypotheses can be advanced and current hypotheses can be retested on new data. Archived data can be used as well to develop or validate new analytic methods or technology. However, we take exception to the characterization of only some classes of data as “unique.” All data are unique, and their uniqueness derives from the focus, techniques, protocols, selection, and expertise inherent in each investigation. p. 292

The NIH policy recognizes, yet incompletely addresses, the fundamental problems presented by the wide diversity and enormous scale of contemporary biomedical data. Data vary in type, size, storage requirements, and significance. Without standards for data formats, descriptive labels, and units of measurements, data may be “available” but not usable for sharing. Standards ease sharing of conforming data, but standards often require a huge amount of effort to establish. p. 292

Peer-to-peer data sharing asks individuals to establish and maintain data archives, but it can take considerable work to convert local research data into a form that can be distributed and shared. The volume of data produced by some techniques can be immense, and largescale data storage imposes requirements for cataloging or indexing as well. Methods are needed to let potential users know that data are available for sharing, what the data represent, and how they may be selected, obtained, and used. Without standards for distributing data, the effort to develop peer-to-peer solutions can potentially require an ad-hoc solution for each pair of investigators. p. 293","Centralized data archives require standards as well. These standards must serve multiple users, including investigators recording or generating the data and investigators accessing the data, and must guide developers and maintainers of the databases. Such larger archives multiply data volume requirements by the number of submitters. However, their development effort is more efficient than for peerto- peer models, as one resource serves many users. Developing and adopting standards is desirable as well for interoperability: coordinating disparate data resources. Here, widespread adoption of standards can avoid the need for individual database-to-database negotiation to link types of data and descriptors. p. 290

Recognition: Sharing should not imply relinquishing. Proper assessment and assignment of credit for data, recognition of the relative value of data acquisition versus data processing, and awareness of the potential for commercial exploitation of freely released data should inform any policy for data sharing. Biological data often require extended development work. Faint signals may require exceptionally difficult development and monitoring of methods for acquisition, filtering, transformation, or reconstruction. A single structural biology dataset may be the culmination of years of exploration of one macromolecule. Complex, massively parallel, high-throughput procedures may generate enormous extended data volumes requiring sophisticated search strategies. Studies in some human subjects require painstaking searching and selection to acquire a specific subject population, followed by extended data collection. Areas such as functional imaging may combine several of these aspects. p. 290

There are technical barriers to reanalysis as well, because datasets alone are rarely sufficient to extract and interpret the information provided by the experiment that generated them. Detailed metadata—descriptions of data including protocols and analytic specifications— are required to understand what the primary data meant in its original context. In the absence of such metadata, analyses of data by an outside investigator are open to misinterpretation. Such misreading could lead to the publication of unwarranted results that might improperly cast doubt upon the conclusions of the original work, or impugn unfairly the competence or scientific integrity of the original investigators. p. 291

The implementation guidelines address concerns of investigators requested to release their own data. We propose easing barriers presented by the reluctance of investigators to use others’ data, arising from technical factors such as format differences as well as more fundamental questions including uncertainty about metadata, internal quality control, or clear traces of transformations or processing. An evolving data sharing policy should address these issues, to forestall collecting and archiving massive data sets that others are reluctant to use. p. 291

Ideally, sharable data should be defined as the combined experimental data and descriptive metadata needed to evaluate and/or extend the results of a study. Policies should recognize that small amounts of adequately characterized, focused data are preferable to large amounts of inadequately defined and controlled data stored in a random repository. Further, data sharing will benefit from recognized, usable technological and descriptive standards for data and metadata. It is in part this diversity that leads us to recommend that a variety of models for data sharing should be acknowledged and even encouraged by the NIH’s Institutes and Centers. p. 292

For many types of data, and many designs of studies, the absence of universal or fixed standards means that viable data pooling requires explicit coordination between producers and users of data. We note that ongoing communication with collaborators aids mutual understanding of data and hypotheses, and avoids many potential pitfalls of analysis. p. 292

To promote data sharing, a citation and credit paradigm must be encouraged. Adata sharing policy should include safeguards against reuse of data without recognition of the original investigator; such use is equivalent to appropriation and should not be tolerated. Where shared data are used, acknowledgment of the sources and collectors should therefore be mandatory, but mere acknowledgement may well not be adequate credit for some types of data. Safeguards should require that reanalysis of data be limited to that which can be meaningfully derived, given restrictions, parameters, or boundaries inherent to the original hypotheses, protocols, and techniques for acquisition and processing. p. 292

Publications are offered with the hope that they will be read and cited extensively. Just as information, once published, is open to any reader, so data once posted should be available to any viewer. Fear about rapid or preemptive reuse or post-hoc analysis of data might be lessened if data were equivalent to publication. Papers will be read, and as a consequence, hypotheses will be tested or advanced, and new suggestions, critiques, or analyses based on published data or ideas will arise. If a similar culture for data existed, including safeguards and a reward system, reluctance to make data available might diminish. p. 292

Finally, we urge Congress, the NIH, and other concerned Federal agencies to increase programs and funding for the development of informatics methods enabling investigators to share data with accuracy, accountability, responsibility, and recognition. Existing programs such as BISTI, the Human Brain Project, and others targeting informatics needs of specific communities or techniques should be expanded, and efforts at each of several levels instituted towards interoperability among current and future projects. p. 292",,"Particularly disturbing to many of us is the relative ease of reuse of data whose acquisition may represent extensive and as-yet-unrewarded effort, especially where performed by new or junior investigators who have not yet established a secure position or reputation. The problem of being scooped with one’s own data may be particularly serious for data sets that are planned to yield multiple reports over time, or for studies where the design itself completely encapsulates a scientific insight. Since meaningful credit for research is largely tied to publication, sharing of experimental design, motivation, or data via extra-publication routes risks inappropriate allocation of scientific credit. p. 292",yes

sensitivity",Biological Invasions,"Exotic species, Invasive species,
Sensitive data, Data sharing, Data synergy",Journal,"Data sensitivity can pose a formidable barrier to data sharing. Knowledge of species current distributions from data sharing is critical for the creation of watch lists and an early warning/rapid response system and for model generation for the spread of invasive species. We have created an on-line system to synthesize disparate datasets of non-native species locations that includes a mechanism to account for data sensitivity. Data contributors are able to mark their data as sensitive. This data is then ‘fuzzed’ in mapping applications and downloaded files to quarter-quadrangle grid cells, but the actual locations are available for analyses. We propose that this system overcomes the hurdles to data sharing posed by sensitive data.",Springer,Biology,"analyses with data
sensitivity",no method,"Data sensitivity: Openly sharing data can lead to poaching. For example, the potential poaching of biological control agents from sites where they have been released is especially worrisome in their initial phase where the cost for organisms can be very great (e.g., $1/each). Poaching at pilot biological control sites can have devastating consequences if the pilot population is not yet established enough to withstand harvesting, whereas if the population were left alone for a certain amount of time, it would probably develop into a good source for collection. A final, tangential area of sensitive data involves location information on rare, threatened, or endangered species. In analyzing the impact of invasive species, it can be helpful to examine their distribution in relation to sensitive species. However, locations of these sensitive species are restricted to agency personnel to help protect them. Poaching can have harmful effects on local populations of these rare species just as it can on establishing biological control sites p. 598

Addressing problems of sensitive data requires first ranking their sensitivity. The most sensitive data could be related to issues of rarity, protected status, or ownership, as described above. However, we asked data providers if it was actually the species, the biological control agent, or the location that was sensitive. We determined that it is actually the location that is sensitive for both species and biological control agents. The exact locations of other organisms such as common non-game species or non-native species found on public lands are generally less sensitive than the locations of game species, commercially valuable species, non-native species on private lands, etc. p. 598 

There are several steps to be considered in securing sensitive data. Important factors include: (1) having a secure login system; (2) having a way to categorize data as sensitive; and (3) effectively managing sensitive data. Therefore, we have taken several steps to implement sensitive data security. First, our website allows different levels of access to website pages and functionality based on a user’s login. Guests (the open user community) can visit the website, but will have limited access. Registered users may request to be approved for higher levels of access. These higher levels include the ability to contribute and manage data, including sensitive data, to the website. Second, before any registered user can contribute data to the website database, they are required to agree to a data sharing agreement. One of the eight points in the agreement states: ‘‘The data provider warrants that they have made the necessary agreements with the original owners of the data and have the proper permissions so that they can make the data available through the National Institute of Invasive Species Science database and website.’’ This statement is to ensure that the contributor of the data has permission for the data to be posted on the website from the original data collectors. For example, someone wanting to post a location in their neighbor’s yard would need permission from their neighbor to post information about their neighbor’s private property. The third step taken to ensure sensitive data security occurs with the actual data upload process. All data contributed to the website are assigned to a ‘‘project’’. Projects are created and managed by website users, and the person who created the project controls what other users belong to the project and therefore can contribute data to the project (i.e., be a project contributor). During the data upload process, the contributor is asked if any of the data being added to the website database needs to be marked as sensitive. If so, they are given four choices for ‘data fuzzing’ including 7.5, 30 min, 1/2 , or 1 grids. The 7.5 min gridding is currently implemented and the others will be added in the future. We have systematic grids for the United States at these different resolutions. The data point will be assigned to the grid cell it falls within, rather than generating a grid cell around the data point with it as the bull’s eye. Restricting access to exact locations of sensitive species or biological control agents also solves other problems dealing with ways people could obtain the sensitive data. For example, the savvy website user is thus unable to determine the location of the sensitive species by obtaining what other species were found with the sensitive one and obtaining a location for those collocated non-sensitive organisms through a species search on the website, as the location of the collocated organisms would be sensitive p. 599

national database.",Springer,Information Technology,basic concepts of electronic data sharing are reviewed and their use illustrated in a datasharing project developed to support Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation reporting to a national database,-,"There are a number of reasons for this, but several are most important: 
1) Structured Data vs. Text. The standard written medical record is composed largely of text words that are not recognizable by standard computer logic. Alternatively, information acquired as “coded” or structured data are termed “computable data elements,” and are more easily subject to analysis. While data-mining techniques are being developed to convert text words to structured data, their accuracy at this point is insufficient for any analysis involving less than large data sets. 
2) Data Standards. Computable, structured data elements become more powerful if they are standardized and shared. For example, data standards are essential in the banking industry, enabling technology like ATM’s, webbased check writing systems, and electronic cash transfers. Even paper checks could not be used without nationwide standards to describe unique checking account and bank identification numbers. In medicine, standards have been developed to describe certain elements such as laboratory test results (LOINC), medical procedures (ICD-9), or high-level diagnoses (SNOMED). HL-7 was developed to define health care data transmission standards. These codes were developed largely to support laboratory test result viewing, billing procedures and other financial or registration purposes. On the other hand, there are no nationally accepted standards to encode most physical or imaging findings, symptoms, most treatment types and outcomes, and so forth. In the absence of data standards, each database system wishing to share data with another requires a unique mapping strategy (interface) to connect the two systems. In a complex computing environment, the resulting “spiderweb” of interfaces becomes impossible to maintain or perhaps even develop. If data standards are uniformly adopted, each computer system knows how to process and store the data without complex mapping. 
3) Most EMRs (Electronic Medical Records) Were Not Designed as Structured, Data Standards-Based Storage Systems. Rather, they were designed to support clinical workflow processes to make health care providers more efficient. Lacking consensus national standards in most areas, it has been natural for vendors to de-emphasize the data standards concept in system design. Further, there is an economic disincentive to standards adoption; if all vendors used the same data standards, they might lose market share as customers could more easily combine modular products from many vendors to support their clinical computing arrays. 
4) Lack of Federal-Wide Commitment to the Data Standards Concept. In the last 5 years, the government has sharply increased their interest in and support for healthcare information technology (IT). This effort has coalesced around the “Meaningful Use” initiative, which provides financial support for “approved” EMR use and function. While this initiative incorporates many desirable patient safety and potential costsaving measures, data standards play at best a marginal role in this effort.","After evaluation anddiscussion, several features of any proposed solution became clear: 1) It would be desirable for all centers to store and transmit their data using uniform data standards, as is done using the HL-7 standards to transmit medical laboratory and demographic data. 2) Providing centers with a uniform domain model in which to store data would facilitate the standards adoption, and encourage use of robust relational databases such as OracleR or SQLServerR, already available in most medical centers for storage of financial data. 3) Once data was contained in a standardized data structure, a single interface containing full security and audit capability could support transmission of the center’s data to the SCTOD. 4) No attempt would be made to develop an application to support individual center operations. Legacy applications, or new vendor-supported products would provide both workflow support and primary data storage. Centers would only be required to develop or purchase a structured data handling mechanism, followed by interfacing or data migration strategies to share the data with the new domain model database on a onetime basis.",,,yes

Pearce 2011,2011,Data sharing: not as simple as it seems,Environmental Health,"epidemiology, ethics, data sharing",Commentary,"In recent years there has been a major change on the part of funders, particularly in North America, so that data sharing is now considered to be the norm rather than the exception. We believe that data sharing is a good idea. However, we also believe that it is inappropriate to prescribe exactly when or how researchers should preserve and share data, since these issues are highly specific to each study, the nature of the data collected, who is requesting it, and what they intend to do with it. The level of ethical concern will vary according to the nature of the information, and the way in which it is collected - analyses of anonymised hospital admission records may carry a quite different ethical burden than analyses of potentially identifiable health information collected directly from the study participants. It is striking that most discussions about data sharing focus almost exclusively on issues of ownership (by the researchers or the funders) and efficiency (on the part of the funders). There is usually little discussion of the ethical issues involved in data sharing, and its implications for the study participants. Obtaining prior informed consent from the participants does not solve this problem, unless the informed consent process makes it completely clear what is being proposed, in which case most study participants would not agree. Thus, the undoubted benefits of data sharing does not remove the obligations and responsibilities that the original investigators hold for the people they invited to participate in the study.
",Springer,Environmental Health,,no method,"Misuse & privacy: universities. We checked with the regulations of the New Zealand Medical Research Council, our main funder, and these stated that data could be shared with other ‘bona fide researchers’, but the decision was to be left up to the researchers who had originally collected the data - it was they who should decide who were ‘bona fide researchers’ who the data could be shared with. Since we did not consider the company, or its hired consultants, to be ‘bona fide researchers’ - in fact, we felt they had a vested interest in the issue, and had seriously misrepresented the published findings of our studies [4-6] - we were not inclined to give them a copy of the data. Furthermore, we were concerned about confidentiality, since New Zealand is a small place, and study participants could potentially be identified on the basis of demographic data, even if the data set was ‘anonymised’. Also, we considered that it was inappropriate for the company to be given the data without specifying in advance what analyses it intended to conduct. p. 1-2

A couple of years ago, one of us (NP) was involved in such a dispute from the other side, where his university-based research group was denied access to a data set collected by the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Our group had produced a series of monitoring reports, funded by the Ministry of Health, on the New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP) [8-11]. The programme was established in 1991, and ever since had been dogged by adverse publicity [12]. Our own reports had highlighted ethnic differences in screening access and uptake; our contract was terminated after four years. Independently of that, we were conducting a programme of research into demographic differences in cervical cancer survival, with a particular focus on ethnic differences [13-15]. We managed to obtain access to a NCSP data set for a small number of cervical cancer cases for one particular set of analyses [14], but our request for further access to the Registry data, in order to investigate ethnic differences in screening, and how these had changed over time, was denied, even though the study was funded by the Health Research Council (HRC) of New Zealand, had received ethical approval, and had also received approval from the National Kaitiaki Group (a Maori Committee which exercises guardianship over the Maori data in the Registry), and the Pacific Women’s Advisory Group. Confidentiality was one of the key reasons given for refusing access to the data, despite all of the necessary approvals having been obtained; one can only speculate whether the possibility of further adverse publicity about the shortcomings of the screening programme may have also played a role. p. 2

On the other hand, there has been increased concern about confidentiality and access (by researchers) to patient records [16]. So access (by other researchers) to data collected by researchers has perhaps become more easy, whereas access (by researchers) to data collected by governments has in some cases become more difficult. p. 3

Privacy; getting rid of identifiers is not enough: The options for data sharing were also recently reviewed by Reiter and Kinney [18]. They noted that simply stripping a data set of unique identifiers such as names, addresses, and identification numbers may not suffice. For example, Sweeney showed that 97% of records in voter registration lists for Cambridge, MA, could be uniquely identified using birth date and 9-digit zip code. In fact similar methods have been used on census data in New Zealand to create cohorts that can be followed over time, and linked with cancer and death registration data [19,20]. p. 3

Who cares for data-sharing policies: Some journals (but few epidemiology journals to date), are now also requiring data-sharing. Journal policies were recently reviewed by Alsheikh-Ali et al [22]. They found that of the 50 original research journals with the highest impact factor, 44 (88%) had a statement about data sharing; there was a wide variety of journal requirements, ranging from requiring the sharing of all primary data to just including a statement in the published manuscript stating that data can be available on request. Of 500 assessed papers, 149 (30%) were not subject to any data availability policy; of the remaining 351 papers, 208 (59%) did not fully adhere to the data availability instructions, most commonly (73%) by not publicly depositing microarray data. It is notable, however, that the majority of papers considered were molecular research, which would carry much less (or often zero) issues of confidentiality compared with epidemiological/ observational studies, which were underrepresented in the sample [22]. This is an important issue for epidemiologists, since journal policies may evolve with a focus on molecular research, where mandatory data sharing does not raise the same ethical issues. 

Common weal paradox: It is clearly not in the public interest to have data collected for research projects funded by public money to be lying unpublished for many years. However, it is also clearly not in the public interest for researchers to feel that it is not worth collecting the data in the first place, and that an easier path to publication, and scientific glory, is simply to regularly request access to data that colleagues have collected. Both extremes are not in the interests of science, or public health. A balanced approach is required in which data is made available, to genuine researchers with a genuine research question, once the initial investigators have had an adequate time to publish their main findings. p. 3

Fear of defamation: The second issue that is usually of major concern to the researchers who collected the data is usually the possibility of the data being obtained by hostile agencies with vested interests in the outcome of the study. Such disputes have perhaps become more frequent in recent years [26]. The usual approach is for the company concerned to hire consultants to criticise the research publicly, either when it appears in print, or even prior to publication [27]. In recent years, these efforts have been further developed and refined with the use of websites and publicity that stigmatizes unwelcome research findings as “junk science” [28]. p. 4

It is striking that most discussions about data sharing focus almost exclusively on issues of ownership (by the researchers or the funders) and efficiency (on the part of the funders). There is usually little discussion of the ethical issues involved in data sharing, and its implications for the study participants, apart from the requirement that (usually) participants are p. 5

It’s one thing to consent that “the researchers may carry out further analyses of the data including analyses of additional health outcomes and/or analyses which involve colleagues from other researcher groups”. It’s completely another issue to agree that ‘anyone, even companies with vested interests, or members of the general public, will be able to obtain a copy of the data from this study, with the names and dates of birth removed’. p. 5
","Restricted-access involves sharing unaltered confidential data with external researchers while preserving confidentiality. This can be achieved by: (i) providing a copy of the data under a license agreement to researchers with legitimate research questions and (possibly) destroyed at project completion; or (ii) researchers may be required to carry out their analyses in a physically and electronically secure facility controlled by the data steward, and may be required to first submit a research proposal. Restricted-data strategies involve unfettered access to data that have been modified before release. The key issue is how much information should be deleted or transformed to ensure data protection without destroying the usefulness of the data [18]. Risks can be reduced by altering data, e.g. by coarsening, data swapping, noise addition, or synthetic data [18]. p. 3

Researcher in charge: So what is the solution? We believe that data sharing is a good idea, and the onus should be on researchers to share their data with other researchers once the main findings have been published. However, we also believe that it is inappropriate to prescribe exactly when or how researchers should preserve and share data, since these issues are highly specific to each study, the nature of the data collected, who is requesting it, and what they intend to do with it. The level of ethical concern will vary according to the nature of the information, and the way in which it is collected - analyses of anonymised hospital admission records may carry a quite different ethical burden than analyses of potentially identifiable health information collected directly from the study participants. p. 5",,"In some instances these activities have gone as far as efforts to block publication [2]. Recent examples include attempts to influence studies on the toxicity of benzene [29] and diesel particulate matter [30], the various industry efforts over many years to influence the conduct and interpretation of research into the health effects of dioxin [31], the industry campaign to undermine an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) chromium (VI) standard [32] and corporate infiltration of a panel convened to set standards for chromium (VI) in California [33]. p. 4",yes

Nature Biotechnology, for example, has published over 20 papers on standards, often after soliciting an open review by the broader community; BioMed Central leads a ‘Publishing Open Data Working Group’ [7] to stimulate debate among authors, publishers, funders, and librarians to identify mutually agreeable ways for implementing data sharing/deposition policies. Funding agencies work to collect community views and feedback by issuing on-going ‘Requests for Information’. But despite these clearly positive signs, their guidance (to authors, applicants and awardees) is not always anchored on solid ground, primarily because they often do not have enough evidence to make informed decisions on which standards for data sharing resources should be recommended. Consequently, their guidance text is often loosely formed, and basically suggests use of “recognised standards”, where these exist, and make data available through existing community resources or databases “where possible”. p. 2",,"Shared, annotated bioscience research data and methods offer new discovery opportunities and prevent unnecessary repetition of work. In the last decade, several data preservation, management, sharing policies, and plans have emerged in response to increased funding for high-throughput approaches in genomics and functional genomics science [1]. In parallel, a growing number of community-based groups have developed minimum information requirements, terminologies, models, and exchange formats to standardize their system of reporting different experiments [2], and they have worked to maximize the interoperability among these standards [3,4]. Researchers and bioinformaticians in both academic and commercial science [5], along with funding agencies and publishers, embrace the concept that standards are pivotal to enriching the annotation of the entities of interest (e.g., genes, metabolites) and the experimental steps (e.g., provenance of study materials, technology and measurement types), to ensure that shared investigations are comprehensible and (in principle) reproducible. p. 1",,yes

models, Hippocampus, Sensory systems, Eye movements, Visual cortex",Paper,"Computational neuroscience is a subfield of neuroscience that develops models to integrate complex experimental data in order to understand brain function. To constrain and test computational models, researchers need access to a wide variety of experimental data. Much of those data are not readily accessible because neuroscientists fall into separate communities that study the brain at different levels and have not been motivated to provide data to researchers outside their community. To foster sharing of neuroscience data, a workshop was held in 2007, bringing together experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, computer scientists, legal experts and governmental observers. Computational neuroscience was recommended as an ideal field for focusing data sharing, and specific methods, strategies and policies were suggested for achieving it. A new funding area in the NSF/NIH Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience (CRCNS) program has been established to support data sharing, guided in part by the workshop recommendations. The new funding area is dedicated to the dissemination of high quality data sets with maximum scientific value for computational neuroscience. The first round of the CRCNS data sharing program supports the preparation of data sets which will be publicly available in 2008. These include electrophysiology and behavioral (eye movement) data described towards the end of this article.",Springer,Computational Neuroscience,Workshop University Toronto; enabling data-sharing,Workshop,,"In particular, the contributing lab should determine when—and to what extent—the data is made available, and the conditions under which it can be used. Two endeavors are critical to advance data sharing in neuroscience: (1) the development of generally applicable database techniques and (2) pragmatic focal approaches for data sharing of particular types of data. There are already a number of successful focal activities of data sharing in neuroscience (see first paragraph in this section). The expansion of such focused efforts to more data types will have a high impact in the near future. Initiating and shaping communities that share certain data types can help define the specifications of database technology required for organization of neuroscience data across data types. p. 49

The analysis of experimental data gathered in an individual lab by multiple research groups with different perspectives is expected to significantly enhance understanding in neuroscience. & New scientific insights are expected if experimental data from several labs are combined and subjected to meta analyses that are unfeasible with individual data sets. & Increased transparency, reproducibility and comparability of neuroscience results. Labs may be able to crosscheck their own results against those of other labs in a more quantitative manner than would be possible based on journal publications. & Comprehensive repositories for neuroscience data and methods will be invaluable for neuroscience education. & Availability of web-based teaching infrastructures for students and investigators. Such infrastructures could consist of tutorials including data and teaching material made by biologists, as well as bibliographies of review articles and links to relevant websites. & Creation of test beds for improving and benchmarking methods for analyzing and modeling neuroscience data could accelerate progress in software tools critical for basic neuroscience and clinical research p. 49

The workshop participants identified important activities that the planned data sharing activity should include: The central services and infrastructure should provide: 1) Service to resource contributors: The major role of an infrastructure for data sharing is to lessen the burden on contributors to make their data/resources available. This includes making it easy to convert and upload data, safeguarding data, and relieving contributors from having to provide support to individual users. 2) Service to data users: The repository web site should offer a means of indexing and flexible online-access Neuroinform (2008) 6:47–55 49 and visualization. Further, each resource should have its individual facilities for user groups, such as a FAQ list and discussion board to enable problem resolution based on user interactions. 3) Ontologies: Experience gained from preparing data sets for sharing should be used to create and refine adequate ontologies for describing the data and metadata. 4) Monitoring of usage: Tracking and evaluating the usage is a very important measure for credit assignment to the resource contributors. Further, it is an important indicator to steer the activities in data sharing.5) Expandable infrastructure: Although the initial scope is limited, it is important to set up the infrastructure, such as data formats, data transmission and browsing methods, and web resources so that they may be expanded and enhanced over time. Additional resources (in addition to research resources): 6) Teaching tools: Explanatory tutorials for the shared resources will not only allow potential users to get oriented and acquainted with the data, they are also online facilities that can substantially improve education in neuroscience. 7) Challenges and competitions: To encourage new interdisciplinary approaches in neuroscience, contributions should be encouraged that can be used for organization of competitions and challenges. Good existing examples of such activities are the Berkeley Prediction Challenge (J. Gallant, F. Theunissen, http:// neuralprediction.berkeley.edu/) and the Lausanne competition (W. Gerstner, A. Roth, F. Schuermann, R. Jolivet, http://icwww.epfl.ch/∼gerstner/QuantNeuron Mod2007/challenge.html) for predicting single neuron behavior. Such contributions should raise interesting questions and/or should offer benchmark environments for evaluating and comparing different solutions (e.g., data sets with some ground truth for comparing spike sorting algorithms). Recommended strategies and cautions: 8) Responding to market demands: The data sharing activity should enable demand-driven scientific foci in the area of computational neuroscience. Thus, the main goal of the program should be to create an interactive market place for resources of particular significance for the field rather than creating a large repository for everything. 9) Funding mechanism for data contributions: To select contributions for funding, it was recommended to use a reviewing process involving outside reviewers to judge quality and importance. 10) Avoid trying to be all things to all people: Today, no single initiative for sharing resources over the web can be all encompassing. It will be important that the planned data sharing activity closely ties in with other neuroscience initiatives. This includes the exchange with similar efforts (Gardner 2004) and the involvement with national (eg. Neural Information Framework by NIH—neurogateway.org, and Neuroscience Database Gateway by SfN—ndg.sfn.org), as well as international coordinating efforts (e.g. International Neuroinformatics Coordination Facility in Stockholm; Bjaalie and Grillner 2007). 11) Answer the needs of many: Experiences with current activities (e.g. competitions described under item 7, above) suggest that on-line availability alone is insufficient to foster broad use of a neurophysiology data set. Therefore, user-friendliness and attentiveness to user feedback are essential. 12) Seek dialogue with scientific community: The workshop discussed the initial procedures to start the effort in data sharing in neuroscience. As this effort is developing, feedback from the relevant communities will be crucial for success. 13) Sensitivity to specific problems with data sharing in neuroscience: The specific problems brought up were (1) the difficulty of communicating all relevant metadata about experimental conditions without direct interaction between contributors and data users, and (2) confidentially issues connected with drawing public attention to animal studies. 14) Miscellaneous concerns: Software is scalable, humans are not. Human costs to generate Human costs to generate, share, access data. Security and privacy: think about security up front! Keep distribution/legal issues in mind (copyrighted stimulus material/disclaimer). Be aware of HIPAA, etc. Software used to setup the repository should be open source and documented. p. 50

Metadata: The Metadata of an Experiment Neuroscience experiments involve the generation and manipulation of large quantities of both raw and processed data. Without knowing the precise acquisition parameters and the experimental conditions the raw data are meaningless. Moreover, only when keeping track of the exact history of the analytic steps can an analysis result be correctly interpreted. All these metadata are typically scattered and too often lost. The ability to reanalyze one’s own data depends critically on access to the totality of this disparate, information; the problem compounds when sharing the data. In the data preparation process the description of metadata will probably take the majority of the work of the data contributor. The metadata should include: & Description of experimental conditions/experimental paradigms etc. & Species, age of the animal, etc. & Surgical procedures & Recording technique (electrode type, clamp method, etc.) & Positions of recording electrodes & Information of recorded cells, such as cell anatomy, type and laminar position & Tools/procedures used to process the data (e.g., type and parameters of spike sorting) & Information on how stimuli were generated & Information on how the timing of the stimuli is correlated with the recordings & For cells in the visual system, if available, the size and location (eccentricity) of stimuli in retinal coordinates. & Known caveats about use of the data (identified artifacts, etc.) & Links to publications p.51",,"In practice, there are social and technical obstacles for creating public databases in neuroscience (Ascoli 2006). Currently, experimenters have reason to worry that sharing data could work against them and has no clear benefit. There is no established mechanism to provide credit for sharing data, and, conversely, in competitive situations shared data could even be used unfairly by reviewers in confidential paper reviews. Further, experimentalists are concerned about misinterpretation of their data by individuals who are insufficiently familiar with the experimental procedures. Theorists often underestimate the intricacies of interpreting experimental data appropriately. Also, it is important to realize that large gaps in language and ways of thinking between experimenters and theorists must be overcome. Many theorists believe that complex and seemingly disparate processes are based on a small set of basic principles. In contrast, biologists are aware of myriads of details that are necessary to fully understand the experimental component of the work. A principal technical obstacle to data sharing in neuroscience is that there is currently no standard for specifying the metadata required for understanding a data set. p. 48",yes

Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what con- ditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice.",WILEY,Information Science,"Overarching and general research data ""The model proposed here is intended to provoke discus- sion among the many stakeholders in research data.

Methods During May and June 2009, as part of a wider consultation on methods for releasing data to researchers, three focus groups (n = 19) were conducted exploring lay attitudes towards the traditional ‘warehouse’ model commonly used in medical research for delivering anonymized National Health Service (NHS) data to researchers. The focus groups explored different processes such as the copying of data, use of programmers for linkage and anonymization, the transfer of data and governance. Results The recognition of the positive aspects of medical research and desire to support it formed the context for discussions. Nonetheless, individuals varied in their attitudes to the use of anonymized data extracts for research from their health records (without consent); although some appeared positive wanted to be asked to consent for this use. Furthermore, participants were acutely aware of security breaches of NHS information nevertheless, they continued to display a high level of trust in NHS staff. Participants were concerned about the practicalities of the warehouse model and relied on their own life experiences to make sense of the model (using analogies with ‘banks’ or ‘libraries’). The general attitude towards the processes underlying the warehouse model might best be captured by the term ‘ambivalence’. Conclusions This research (1) offers unique insights into views of anonymization of health data extracts, how it is undertaken and data are transferred and (2) adds to an increasing body of work that demonstrates that a minority of individuals are concerned about consent, even when data are anonymized although (3) those concerned about ano- nymization do not necessarily seek resolution through gaining consent.",WILEY,Medical,sharing of health data for research purposes,"During May and June 2009, as part of a wider consultation on methods for releasing data to researchers, three focus groups (n = 19) were conducted exploring lay attitudes towards the traditional ‘warehouse’ model commonly used in medical research for delivering anonymized National Health Service (NHS) data to researchers.

When stories are shared, the participant/ researcher power imbalance is weakened and a safe and trusting environment is created. Heliker (2009) states that story-sharing can be used to strengthen cooperative researcher/participant relationships by fostering rapport and dissolving power inequities.

NCBI has made a special effort over the past three years to support the identification of genome variants with potential clinical relevance. In 2006, NCBI staff, in collaboration with the genetic testing community and LSDBs, began developing standard sequences for reporting human variation (RefSeqGene; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/RSG/). To date, more than 85 LSDBs and testing laboratories have partnered with NCBI to create about 530 of the current 1,150 RefSeqGene records. Responding to community suggestions, NCBI released two web tools to facilitate submission of information about variation according to the HGVS standard and added a new viewer to simplify review of variation that may be of clinical significance (see www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ RefSeq/RSG/LSDB.shtml.) Early in 2008, NCBI and GEN2PHEN (http://www.gen2phen.org) began an active collaboration to establish an internationally recognized sequence standard for reporting variation, the Locus Region Genomic or LRG, for which RefSeqGene will be an important starting point (see also www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/RSG/LRG.shtml.) Also in 2008, NCBI arranged with Dr. den Dunnen and Dr. Fokkema to become an LOVD host-site, and is currently loading LSDB data in support of several disorder-specific advocacy groups. Last year, dbSNP also included HGVS mutation names on its display of variants and added HGVS nomenclature as a query function. These tools and reports are founded on NCBI’s commitment to (1) providing attribution to data submitters, (2) providing web links to specialized databases that have more detailed information, (3) standardizing access to submitted data, and (4) facilitating comparison of multiple submissions. We value our long relation- ship with LSDBs and the clinical genetics community and will continue to devote considerable resources to supporting the principles outlined by den Dunnen et al.

Publishing the findings of research in peer reviewed journals implies a high level of confidence by the authors in the veracity of their interpretation. Therefore it stands to reason that researchers should be prepared to share their raw data with other researchers, so that others may enjoy the same level of confidence in the findings. Method: In a prospective study, 29 corresponding authors of original research articles in a medical journal (the British Medical Journal) were contacted to ascertain their preparedness to share the data from their research. The email contact was in one of two forms, a general request and a specific request. The type of request a researcher received was randomly allocated. Findings: Researchers receiving specific requests for data were less likely, and slower, to respond than researchers receiving general requests. Only one researcher released data. Most researchers were reluctant to release their data. Some required further information, clarification, or authorship. Interpretation: The general reluctance of researchers to consider requests for their data is of concern. It raises questions about the level of confidence that should be placed on their interpretations of the data.

Can institutions guarantee that their repositories will continue to make this data available for, say, 50 years? Or will institutional cuts force them—reluctantly—to delete data that is not perceived as essential? Perhaps the data sets should be hosted by the journal’s publisher. But, the same data set may have given rise to several papers in different journals, and so on which publisher should the hosting burden fall?"" (675)","""Data sharing is a natural extension of open access. If we accept (as we do) that the papers which result from publicly funded research should be freely available to other researchers then it follows that the data on which those papers are based should also be publicly available so that “other fellow” can carry out his or her analyses and perhaps think of other causes that could possibly explain—or contradict—the results."" (675)","""Remembering that only about one in ten papers submitted to BJET is finally accepted for publication, I wonder what percentage of the other nine submissions could have been avoided—or perhaps been more accurately focused on gaps in our knowledge—if earlier experimental data had been readily available when the research was originally planned."" (675)

""On the positive side, there is the kudos associated with authorship of good data sets. It is argued that this is evidence of scholarship that is on a par with authorship of a paper, and deserves similar academic recognition. There is also some evidence from life sciences that data-sharing can lead to increased citation rates (see Piwowar, Day and Fridsma, 2007)."" (675)","""Perhaps the most problematic issue is that of subject confidentiality. The steps taken to preserve the confidentiality of subjects participating in educational research may need to be far more rigorous if the data is to be made public. If the data is kept securely by the individual or group who carried out the research, then it may be sufficient to ensure that the data is anonymised, but extra steps will be needed if it goes outside this closed community.""

""Grant money is harder than ever to come by, and competition for space in professional journals is fierce.

Despite being a logical leader in data management and curation, information science competes with other disciplines in handling research data and often fails to demonstrate its own expertise. Two developments presented through the annual Research Data Access & Preservation (RDAP) Summits hold promise for promoting the field and demonstrating its relevance to data management topics. First, the use of formal and systematic planning for data management is expanding, driven by requirements of many funding agencies. Second, research is offering insights into how researchers appraise, share and reuse data, with identification of data quality indicators related to satisfaction. As the effective use of research data becomes more pressing, the field of information science should lead in demonstrating the value derived from professional data curation, and the RDAP community must define and articulate its own research agenda.",WILEY,Information Science,No original reseach.

Emerging from scientists’ discussions on sharing are several dimensions suggestive of the variation in both what it means ‘to share’ and how these processes are carried out. This research indicates that data curation services will need to accommodate a wide range of subdisciplinary data characteristics and sharing practices. As part of a larger set of strategies emerging across academic institutions, institutional repositories (IRs) will contribute to the stewardship and mobilization of scientific research data for e-Research and learning. There will be particular types of data that can be managed well in an IR context when characteristics and practices are well understood. Findings from this study elucidate scientists’ views on ‘sharable’ forms of data—the particular representation that they view as most valued for reuse by others within their own research areas—and the anticipated duration for such reuse.

""Second, the focus on universal solutions for curation activities often applies to common and high-level service models. However, this does not generally account for research that functions at a more community level, and scientists’ willingness to exchange data and share publicly, which is influenced by differing research and publishing practices, data-generation methods and existing data infrastructures (Pritchard et al. 2005; RIN 2008).""

""When scientists talked about data sharing, they described practices that satisfied two fundamentally different needs—keeping data private or making it public. The instances considered here suggest that, beyond motivation, the effects of exposing or supplying one’s data have differing implications for IR development. Supplying data involves either targeted transfer of data to and from current collaborators or close colleagues or distribution on request; these have the effect of keeping data private to some extent.""

Misuse incidents experienced by scientists in this study influenced their views on the appeal of data sharing, decreasing their willingness to share and increasing their cynicism in data-sharing initiatives, but they also had a real impact on their behaviour. The most dramatic case unfolded during the course of staged interviews, where a geologist had experiences in which other scientists published data he had shared while he was still working on his own analysis.""(4033)

  ",PLOS Biology,"Phylogegraphy, Sequence alignment, Data processing, Plan phylogenetics, DNA sequences, Reproducibility, Data management, Evolutionary biology",Journal,"Given that reproducibility is a pillar of scientific research, the preservation of scientific knowledge (underlying data) is of paramount importance. The standard of reproducibility can be evaluated based on criteria of methodological rigor and legitimacy, which is sometimes used to distinguish “hard” from “soft” sciences. In phylogenetics, a discipline that routinely uses DNA sequences to build trees reflecting organismal relationships, the scale of data collection and the complexity of analytical software have both increased dramatically during the past decade. Consequently, the ability to navigate publications and reproduce analyses is more challenging than ever. When DNA sequencing was initially employed in systematics during the late 1980s, there was some reluctance to deposit nucleotide sequences in open repositories such as GenBank [1]. This ultimately changed when high-impact journals (e.g., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nature, Science) began requiring GenBank submission as a prerequisite for publication [1],[2]; now virtually every evolutionary biology journal observes this requirement (but see [3]).",PLOS,Biology,,,"Our findings indicate that while some journals (e.g., Evolution, Nature, PLOS Biology, Systematic Biology) currently require nucleotide sequence alignments, associated tree files, and other relevant data to be deposited in public repositories, most journals do not have these requirements; resultantly, the systematics community is doing a poor job of making the actual datasets available. More troublesome perhaps is that the situation has barely improved over the 12 years covered in this study (Figures 1 and 2). In addition, when data are deposited, they often do not include critical information such as what was actually included in data alignments (e.g., what characters were excluded, full taxon names; see Table S1 and Figure S1). Without accurate details describing how alignments were implemented, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to faithfully reproduce the study results. Additionally, parameters for the program BEAST are rarely made available for scrutiny. Lastly, in many cases when data were not deposited to TreeBASE, the authors indicated that the data could be obtained directly from them; however, our survey indicates this is typically not the case (only ~40% of authors even respond, and of these only a small percent actually provide the requested data)—hence, many alignments and analysis parameters seem to be lost forever."," Suffice it to say, if large parts of previously published phylogenies are reused, the original source(s) should at least be cited. Additionally, after the arduous process authors face in preparing and uploading manuscripts, the last thing they want to do is struggle with still another upload, especially when it is optional. Thus, databases that house information (e.g., TreeBASE, Dryad) must ensure that the process of entering alignments, trees, and other relevant data is user-friendly and not time consuming.",,,yes
